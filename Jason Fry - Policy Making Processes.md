| Case Study: The smog in delhi |  |  |
| [Aseem Prakash, Nives Dolšak, Thomas Bernauer and Liam McGrath, “Delhi is](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/11/11/delhis-been-hit-with-toxic-smog-why-its-political/) [Blanketed with Toxic Smog. This is Why.” The Washington Post, November](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/11/11/delhis-been-hit-with-toxic-smog-why-its-political/) [11, 2017](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/11/11/delhis-been-hit-with-toxic-smog-why-its-political/)  | Context: Delhi experienced extreme air pollution in Nov 2017, in response the city wants to take extreme measures.  2 reasons for this spike in pollution: **1\)**farmers in neighboring states upwind are burning straw from their last rice crop **2\)**politicians are wary of trying to prevent crop burning as they can antagonize the farm lobbyists and thus lose electoral support Whats causing the smog? In nearby states farmers have three weeks to clear fields so they can plant wheat and winter crops after summer straw Democracies should have less pollution as voters want cleaner environments and gov responds to voters but in India the effects of the climate are not felt by the most powerful (rich) and those that lobby for resistance.  Rural vs urban demands In rural areas crop burning occurs, in rich areas the pollution is felt in new delhi. Urban centers have imposed laws against crop burning but farmers are apposing these laws and continue. Solution? Federal gov subsidies that can help farmers shift to alternative methods. Cant cause mass change because the costs of pollution are felt widely and they are only during winter months. Thus alternative pollution mitigation takes place like converting diesel to natural gas, creating driving schedules for cars, banning of firework sales.  Findings: even in well functioning democracy local or regional pollution problems are difficult to solve. Maybe only courts can save citizens and mitigate political conflict.  | Delhi’s toxic smog is not primarily a failure of awareness or local policy, but a governance failure rooted in federalism, electoral incentives, and uneven distribution of costs and benefits. While Delhi repeatedly imposes emergency measures on its residents, the main pollution source—crop burning in neighboring states—remains politically difficult to regulate. The case illustrates how democracy and affluence alone do not guarantee environmental protection, and why effective solutions likely require coordinated federal action, farmer compensation, and stronger roles for institutions insulated from political pressure. |
| [Dipoppa, G., Gulzar, S., No Smoke Without a Fire: Bureaucratic Incentives,](https://osf.io/2xv3w/files/nyhz4) [Crop Burning, and Pollution in South Asia.](https://osf.io/2xv3w/files/nyhz4)  | Context: crop burning in india is causing health risks and annual deaths. Legal bans are doing nothing to help and pollution spillovers are cross district and national borders. Policy Summary: illegal in India since 1981 and in pakistan since 2010s. Incentives to enforce these rules are weak because there are high monitoring costs and dispersed polluters, limited payoff from punishment, and one-off nature of burning. Existing policy tools are information campaigns, subsidies for mechanized alternatives and punitive measure such as fines or criminal cases Core Recommendations:  bureaucrats respond to incentives as if it's in their own jurisdiction fire incidence drops, when it affects neighboring jurisdictions there is a higher tolerance.  Punishment of some farmers generates deterrence effects.  | This study demonstrates that crop residue burning in South Asia persists not because enforcement is impossible, but because bureaucratic incentives are misaligned. Using satellite, meteorological, administrative, and health data, the authors show that district officials actively reduce burning when pollution affects their own jurisdictions but tolerate it when costs spill over to neighbors. Bureaucratic enforcement—especially visible punishment—creates meaningful deterrence, contradicting the belief that dispersed pollution sources are ungovernable. These enforcement patterns have large downstream consequences, including substantial increases in infant and child mortality from prenatal pollution exposure. The findings imply that strengthening local bureaucratic incentives and enforcement capacity, rather than relying solely on centralization or new laws, could yield major improvements in air quality and public health. |
| Case Study: What should be done about the wild gyrations in US federal climate policy?  |  |  |
| [Friedman, Lisa. "Democrats Designed the Climate Law to Be a Game Changer.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/22/climate/epa-supreme-court-pollution.html) [Here's How." The New York Times. (22 August 2022](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/22/climate/epa-supreme-court-pollution.html)  | In 2022 after supreme court ruling EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under existing law and congress passed a major climate law designed to address the limitation of EPA authority. And they are now allowed to call greenhouse gases an air pollutant and thus EPA can regulate them.  Policies: policy shift allows EPA to pursue rules that promote renewable energy adoption and restrict emissions from power plants, cars, and other major sources. Policy Implications:  makes regulatory status durable and climate rules more defensible in court.  Policymakers can counter judicial limitations on executive agency authority by using legislative text that addresses contested doctrines   | Following a 2022 *Supreme Court* ruling that curtailed the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions due to lack of clear statutory authority, Congress enacted a climate law that **explicitly defines greenhouse gases as air pollutants** under the **Clean Air Act**. This legislative change was written to address the Court’s reasoning and provide the EPA with a firm legal basis for regulating emissions from energy, transportation, and industrial sources. The policy approach signals that when courts constrain agency action, **clear legislative language** can restore and strengthen regulatory authority. By embedding greenhouse gases in statute, the law makes future climate regulations more legally defensible and advances federal capacity to tackle climate change. This shift highlights how statutory design can directly influence climate governance and regulatory resilience.  |
| [Milman, Oliver and Dharna Noor, 2024\. “The Inflation Reduction Act’s](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/09/inflation-reduction-act-winners-swing-states-harris-biden-communications/) [Biggest Winners? Swing States,” Mother Jones, 25 Sept 2024\.](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/09/inflation-reduction-act-winners-swing-states-harris-biden-communications/)  | IRA passed in 2022 and surged clean energy manufacturing in the US. 150 billion in clean energy has been announced. There are multiple swing states \- AZ, GA, MI, NV, NC, PA, WI. These same states will decide the outcome of the next presidential election that will either continue or revoke all of the climate change efforts.  Policy Summary IRA is largest climate and energy law in US Relies on long term uncapped tax credits fro clean energy manufacturing Consumer rebates for electric vehicles Grants fro industrial emissions and domestic supply chain reshoring Only 40% of US citizens have heard of it Core Recommendations Democrats have failed to effectively communicate the laws benefits and what the results are from doing this Republicans have already labeled this a bad policy and make up over 50% of TV watchers Democrat should: have more localized IRA messaging around the effect on this bill to the people, put this onto the young and colored people | The Inflation Reduction Act has quietly driven a massive clean energy manufacturing boom, with nearly half of its investment flowing to seven pivotal swing states that will decide the next election. While the law is reshaping the U.S. economy—creating jobs, revitalizing industrial regions, and accelerating climate action—most voters remain unaware of its existence or benefits. Democrats have struggled to communicate the IRA’s impact, allowing critics to define it in negative terms despite broad latent public support. The article argues this disconnect represents a major political missed opportunity, especially among climate-concerned demographics critical to Democratic electoral success. Whether the IRA becomes a lasting political asset or a forgotten achievement may depend less on policy outcomes than on messaging and visibility. |
| 2 opposing views on BBB | [With the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ U.S. to Reverse Course on Clean Energy” Yale E360 (7 July 2025\)](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/big-beautiful-bill-renewable-energy-china) What? BBB is enacted and phases out tax credits for wind, solar and EVs while expanding fossil fuel extraction on federal lands. Occurs amid global competition over clean energy leadership Policy Summary:  Eliminated policies: tax credits for wind and solar power, tax credits for EVs Fossil fuel support increased  Impacts: household energy costs rising, 8 million less EVs, dropped Paris Agreement. Core findings: clean energy investment has begun declining more. US emissions are only to fall by 3% by 2030, and US is falling away from global competition in clean technology.  Evidence and result: rapid electrification abroad. China doubled its electricity share of its energy use since 2000 and installed over half of all new global wind and solar capacity and thus captures 75% of clean tech investment.  [Alex Muresianu, “How the One Big Beautifu Bill Changes Green Energy Tax Credits,” Tax Foundation (31 July 2025).](https://taxfoundation.org/blog/big-beautiful-bill-green-energy-tax-credit-changes/) What? BBB eliminates consumer facing clean energy credits and expands select fuel and carbon capture subsidies. The changes reflect a broader retreat from subsidy based climate policy. Policy Summary: comples restrictions and phaseouts for business power sector credits and thus targets expansions of clean fuel and carbon credits.  Gains from phaseout:  Revenue gain of 484.5 billion 267 billion from repealing consumer EV and building credits 257 billion from limiting power sector and business credits 40 billion cost from credit expansions Core findings **Consumer credit repeals** (EVs, residential efficiency) are justified on efficiency grounds: purchases would have been made without subsidies and the benefits are skewed toward higher-income households. Business credit changes are more problematic: wind and solar lose access to credits unless projects are already underway, credits favor nuclear & geothermal & hydro | The One Big Beautiful Bill Act represents a decisive reversal of U.S. clean energy policy, dismantling federal support for renewables and electric vehicles while favoring fossil fuel development. Analysts project higher household energy costs, sharply reduced renewable deployment, and millions fewer EVs sold as a result. The law also collapses U.S. climate ambitions, cutting projected emissions reductions to just 3 percent by 2030 and formalizing withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Politically, the bill defies expectations that clean energy job growth would protect tax credits in Republican districts, even as thousands of jobs are lost. Strategically, the shift leaves the United States falling behind rapidly electrifying economies—especially China—cementing a global divide between emerging clean-energy leaders and a U.S. increasingly defined by fossil fuel dependence. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act represents a decisive shift away from the Inflation Reduction Act’s subsidy-heavy approach to climate policy. While the repeal of consumer-facing clean energy tax credits improves fiscal discipline and tax neutrality, the law’s treatment of business credits introduces new complexity and compliance burdens, particularly through foreign entity restrictions. At the same time, OBBBA paradoxically expands some of the least efficient climate-related subsidies, including clean fuels and carbon capture tied to fossil fuel extraction. The broader political economy logic behind green energy subsidies—that they would create durable pro-climate constituencies—has failed to materialize. In the long run, the article argues that policymakers should reconsider **carbon pricing** as a more efficient, fiscally sustainable, and resilient alternative to subsidy-based climate policy. |
| [Burn-Murdoch, John, “How Red Texas became a model for green energy,’” FT.](https://www.ft.com/content/ef2f6f8e-60df-4ccd-8c4f-ef5cd0eb3176) [23 May 2024](https://www.ft.com/content/ef2f6f8e-60df-4ccd-8c4f-ef5cd0eb3176) | What?  Texas has rapidly emerged as a national leader in solar power, despite its reputation as a fossil-fuel-dominated, Republican-led state. In March 2024, Texas generated **more electricity from solar than from coal** for the first time. Policy Summary: Texas has no clean energy mandates like CA. The boom has been driven by economics of solar power that are favorable and efficient grid connections. They have a connect and manage model that allows projects to connect based on local grid requirements Findings: economic incentives can outweigh political ideology in driving the energy transition. And clean energy has surpassed political ideologies in Texas. This is because the rural areas work on these sites and 60% receive the majority of the renewable energy. Once economic factors seemed to be beneficial they jumped in on them.  | Texas’s rapid rise as America’s leading solar power state illustrates how the energy transition can advance independently of partisan politics. Driven by falling costs, investor incentives, and streamlined grid rules, solar deployment has surged even in a state culturally and politically aligned with fossil fuels. The resulting economic benefits—especially for rural, conservative communities—have reshaped local political dynamics and blunted legislative resistance to renewables. Texas’s experience suggests that market forces and regulatory design can be more decisive than ideology in accelerating clean energy adoption. In this sense, red Texas has become an unexpected blueprint for how the U.S. might scale clean energy nationwide. |

| Case Study: How the Oil Palm Industry Decided it should Stop Deforestation |  |  |
| [Paige McClanahan “Can Indonesia Increase Palm Oil Output without](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/11/indonesia-palm-oil-destroy-forests) [Destroying its Forest?” The Guardian (11 Sept 2013).](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/11/indonesia-palm-oil-destroy-forests)  | What? Indonesia is the world's largest producer and consumer of palm oil and wants to increase production. Environmental groups question whether production can expand without accelerating deforestation and biodiversity loss. Policy Summary:  Palm oil is economically central to indonesia and ⅓ of production comes from smallholder farmers. In 2011 the government put a halt on new forest clearing permits The gov also promotes sustainability certification and yield improvements rather than large scale land expansion Core Findings: Environmental groups argue that palm oil is the single largest driver of deforestation and accounts for 25% of forest loss between 2009-2011 Government moratorium has loopholes that deceives citizens as the land protected wasn't land that was going to be used and there was a surge of permits moments before the ban Solutions Yield improvements: Older palm varieties produce \~4 tonnes of oil per hectare annually. Newer planting materials can nearly double yields under proper conditions. Use of degraded land: World Resources Institute identified 14 million hectares of degraded land in Kalimantan potentially suitable for palm oil. Expansion onto degraded land could meet growth needs for up to 20 years without clearing forests. The main challenge is negotiating land access with local communities. NGO findings: Greenpeace attributes a large share of Indonesia’s deforestation to palm oil expansion.  |  |
| [Nathanael Johnson, “The Last Holdout Among Big Palm Oil Businesses Joins](https://grist.org/food/the-last-holdout-among-big-palm-oil-producers-joins-no-deforestation-pledge/) [No- Defore](https://grist.org/food/the-last-holdout-among-big-palm-oil-producers-joins-no-deforestation-pledge/)station Pledge,” Grist (5 Dec 2014).  | What? Singapore based palm oil company Musim Mas will adopt a no deforestation policy for palm oil purchases They control 18% of global palm oil supply 96% of global palm oil production now does this Policy Summary: no deforestation, no peatland development, no exploitation of workers or communities.  Goal is to curb environmental damage linked to palm oil Reflects pressure from environmental NGOs an consumer facing brands rather than gov regulation HOW WERE NGOs involved? NGOs such as **Greenpeace**, **Rainforest Action Network**, and **The Forest Trust** identified Musim Mas as the *last major holdout* and focused public attention on its role in deforestation. Rather than pressuring governments, NGOs targeted **buyers and traders** at the top of the supply chain. By pushing large traders to adopt no-deforestation policies, NGOs indirectly forced **thousands of upstream producers and smallholders** to comply. Set standards: NGOs worked directly with companies to **define what “no deforestation, no peat, no exploitation” means in practice**. NGOs committed to **ongoing oversight**, making clear that pledges were only the first step. Groups like **Forest Heroes** emphasized verification, field audits, and continuous improvement to ensure promises translated into real behavior change. | The decision by Musim Mas to adopt a no-deforestation policy marks a major milestone for the global palm oil industry, bringing 96 percent of production under sustainability commitments. Driven largely by NGO pressure and reputational risk rather than regulation, the shift suggests that corporate norms around forest protection have fundamentally changed. However, environmental advocates caution that promises alone are insufficient without rigorous enforcement throughout complex supply chains, especially among smallholder farmers. The article frames this moment as a significant but fragile victory, where success depends on monitoring and follow-through. Palm oil’s environmental impact, while potentially reduced, remains unresolved until commitments are fully implemented on the ground. |

| Extra Ideas  | About one decade ago, palm oil was seen as one of the most important threats to deforestation. Now that has, to some degree, changed. One reason might be self-regulation by industry. This is an old case, but a pivotal one for an industry that pits production of a key product (palm oil) against an asset that is good for the whole planet (tropical forests). How did the incentives inside the palm oil industry affect the strategy of key players? Pay close attention in this case to the difference between palm oil producers (farmers) and the traders. What roles did NGOs play? |  |

# ✍️ Class 3 \- Collective Action and interest groups

| Reading: Olson, Mancur. The Logic of Collective Action, Harvard University Press, 1965\. Introduction (pp. 1-4), Ch. 1 (pp. 5-16, 33-52), 132-135, 165-167. (40 pages total. | Introduction Attempt to discuss why big groups don't make changes but why a collection of smaller ones do A Theory of Groups and Organizations \- purpose of organization (5-9): furtherance of the interests of their members which also promotes the joining of groups as it is beneficial to further my self interest with this group (frat, union, organization). **Mancur Olson’s Main Ideas on Collective Action** Mancur Olson’s central contribution is to challenge the assumption that **shared interests naturally lead to collective action**. His theory explains why groups that would all benefit from a common outcome often fail to organize or invest in producing it. **1\. Shared Interests Do *Not* Guarantee Collective Action** Olson’s foundational claim is that **rational, self-interested actors will not automatically act to advance their common interests**, even when the benefits of doing so are obvious. Classical political theory assumed that groups would organize whenever collective benefits exceeded collective costs. Olson rejects this assumption as unrealistic once individual incentives are considered. **Key implication for policy:** Agreement on goals (e.g., better health outcomes, disease prevention, scientific progress) is not sufficient to generate cooperation. **2\. Public Goods Create Free-Rider Problems** Olson focuses on **public goods**, which have two defining characteristics: **Non-excludability:** People cannot easily be prevented from benefiting. **Non-rivalry:** One person’s use does not reduce availability to others. Because of these characteristics: Individuals can enjoy the benefits **without contributing**. Rational actors therefore have incentives to **free ride**. In large groups, an individual’s contribution: Has a negligible effect on the overall outcome. Is unlikely to be decisive. Is therefore not worth the private cost. **Policy relevance:** Many policy goals—global health, research, security, environmental protection—are public goods and are therefore systematically underprovided. **3\. Group Size Matters: Large Groups Are Less Effective** One of Olson’s most important insights is that **large groups are worse at collective action than small groups**. **Why large groups fail:** Individual contributions are insignificant relative to total benefit. Monitoring and coordination costs are high. Responsibility is diffuse. Free riding is difficult to detect or punish. **Why small groups succeed:** Individual contributions matter more. Members can observe one another. Social pressure and informal enforcement are easier. **Policy implication:** Universal participation is often less effective than smaller, committed coalitions. **4\. “Privileged Groups” Can Act—But Only Partially** Olson identifies an exception to the general rule: **privileged groups**. A privileged group exists when: At least one actor receives such a large share of the benefit that it is rational for them to provide the good even if others get a free ride. Examples: A dominant state funding global health initiatives. A large philanthropic foundation underwriting research. However: Privileged groups often underprovide relative to the social optimum. They are vulnerable to political or economic shocks. Free riding by others persists. **Policy implication:** Leadership can substitute for cooperation, but it is not a stable or scalable solution. **5\. Voluntary Cooperation Is Insufficient in Large Groups** Olson is explicit that: Moral appeals, norms, and goodwill cannot reliably solve collective action problems at scale. Altruism may exist, but it cannot be assumed. In large groups: Individuals know their contribution will not be pivotal. Even altruistic actors face incentives to defer to others. **Policy implication:** Policy designs that rely on voluntary contributions alone will predictably fail. **6\. Selective Incentives Are Essential** Olson argues that **collective action becomes possible when contributors receive selective incentives**—benefits or penalties that apply only to participants. Selective incentives can be: **Positive:** rewards, access, prestige, material benefits. **Negative:** sanctions, exclusion, penalties. These incentives: Change the individual cost–benefit calculation. Make participation rational even when the collective good is non-excludable. **Policy implication:** Effective institutions embed incentives that reward contribution and deter free riding. **7\. Coercion and Compulsion Often Underpin Successful Collective Action** Olson notes that many successful collective action systems rely on **some form of compulsion**, such as: Taxes Mandatory contributions Binding rules Even democratic systems rely on coercion to provide public goods. **Policy implication:** Pure voluntarism is rarely sufficient; binding commitments or quasi-compulsory mechanisms are often necessary. **8\. Institutional Design Determines Outcomes** Olson’s theory ultimately points to **institutional design**, not preferences, as the decisive factor. Successful collective action depends on: How costs and benefits are distributed Whether participation is mandatory or optional Whether incentives are selective Whether monitoring and enforcement are feasible **Policy implication:** Failures of cooperation are usually institutional failures, not failures of awareness or consensus.  | **Olson Notes (restricted to pp. 1–16, 33–52, 132–135, 165–167) 1\) Shared interests do not automatically produce collective action Simple explanation:** Even if everyone would benefit from a common goal, individuals may still not contribute because they can hope others do the work. **Example:** Everyone wants lower community crime, but many residents skip neighborhood watch meetings because the benefits (safer streets) occur whether they participate or not. **Olson pages:** **pp. 1–3** Olson **2\) Large groups will not reliably act in their common interest without “special devices” Simple explanation:** In large groups, an individual’s contribution rarely determines success, so rational people tend to withhold effort unless there is coercion or some incentive mechanism. **Example:** A national immunization program is funded through taxes and policy mandates; voluntary donations alone would predictably underfund it. **Olson pages:** **pp. 2–3** (also reinforced later in **pp. 44–45** and **p. 51**) Olson **3\) Organizations exist to advance members’ shared interests, but many fail or “perish” Simple explanation:** Organizations form to pursue common interests, but if they do not actually further members’ interests, they weaken or collapse. **Example:** A professional association that provides no tangible member benefits (services, advocacy, networking) struggles to retain dues-paying members. **Olson pages:** **p. 6** Olson **4\) “Common interest” does not mean identical interests Simple explanation:** Members can share one objective while differing on others; organizations focus on what members hold in common. **Example:** Patients share an interest in cheaper medicines but disagree on preferred treatments; patient groups typically mobilize around shared affordability goals. **Olson pages:** **pp. 7–8** Olson **5\) The competitive-market analogy: rational behavior can block collective outcomes Simple explanation:** Just as firms in competitive markets cannot easily coordinate to restrict output, individuals in large groups cannot easily coordinate to provide a shared good. **Example:** In a pandemic, each country has an incentive to “defect” (delay costly restrictions) even if coordinated action would benefit everyone. **Olson pages:** **pp. 9–12** Olson **6\) The state is the central organization because it can compel contributions Simple explanation:** The state provides basic collective goods through taxation/authority because voluntary financing is unreliable at scale. **Example:** Roads and public sanitation are funded through taxes because non-payers cannot easily be excluded from many of their benefits. **Olson pages:** **pp. 13–14** Olson **7\) Definition of a collective (public) good: exclusion is difficult Simple explanation:** A collective good is one where, if it exists for one member, others benefit too; non-payers cannot be easily excluded. **Example:** Disease eradication benefits even those who did not fund eradication campaigns. **Olson pages:** **pp. 14–15** Olson **8\) Free riding is rational when goods are non-excludable Simple explanation:** If you’ll receive the benefit whether you pay or not, the rational strategy is often not to pay. **Example:** People may under-donate to public broadcasting because they can still benefit if others donate enough to keep it running. **Olson pages:** **pp. 15–16** Olson **Group Size, Organization, and Incentives (pp. 33–52) 9\) Small groups can sometimes provide collective goods without coercion Simple explanation:** In some small groups, each member’s share of the benefit is large enough that voluntary contribution becomes rational. **Example:** Two adjacent landowners can rationally split the cost of a drainage ditch because each receives a large share of the benefit. **Olson pages:** **pp. 33–34** Olson **10\) Even successful small groups may not provide the socially “optimal” amount Simple explanation:** Small groups may provide *some* of the collective good, but still stop short of the ideal level because they fund only what is privately worthwhile. **Example:** A regional coalition funds a modest disease surveillance system but underinvests in surge capacity that would benefit a wider set of stakeholders. **Olson pages:** **p. 34** Olson **11\) Inequality of stake (“size”) increases the chance the good is provided—but encourages free riding by others Simple explanation:** If one member benefits much more than others, that member may pay more (or all) of the cost—while smaller-stake members contribute less. **Example:** A major economy funds much of a global health initiative because it benefits disproportionately from stability, while others undercontribute. **Olson pages:** **pp. 34–36** Olson **12\) Inclusive vs. exclusive collective goods: exclusion rules change the coordination problem Simple explanation:** If nonparticipants cannot be excluded (“inclusive”), free riding is easier; where exclusion is possible (“exclusive”), different coordination failures occur (e.g., holdouts). **Example:** A cartel-like restriction of output requires near-unanimous participation; even one holdout can unravel the arrangement. **Olson pages:** **pp. 40–41** Olson **13\) Large groups generally cannot provide a collective good without coercion or non-collective inducements Simple explanation:** When no member receives a sufficiently large fraction of the total benefit, the good will not be provided unless members are compelled or separately rewarded. **Example:** Broad consumer interests (like price stability) often lack organization because benefits are diffuse and no one actor captures enough to pay the costs. **Olson pages:** **pp. 44–45** Olson **14\) When informal coordination is enough vs. when formal organization is necessary Simple explanation:** Olson specifies conditions under which coordination can be informal (small groups) and when it requires formal organization (larger/intermediate groups). **Example:** A small clinic network can coordinate informally on shared procurement; a national system usually requires formal institutions and rules. **Olson pages:** **pp. 46–47** Olson **15\) Taxonomy of groups: privileged, intermediate, and latent Simple explanation: Privileged group:** at least one member will pay enough to secure the good. **Intermediate group:** organization/coordination may work, but is uncertain. **Latent group:** individuals have little incentive to contribute; organization is unlikely. **Example:** Privileged: one major donor funds most of a program. Intermediate: a small set of states coordinate a preparedness fund. Latent: “global consumers” who all want lower prices but are too diffuse to organize. **Olson pages:** **pp. 50–52** (taxonomy introduced on **pp. 50–51**, then linked to size/behavior on **p. 52**) Olson **16\) Selective incentives: the core mechanism that makes contribution rational Simple explanation:** Incentives must be **selective**—available only to contributors (or imposed only on noncontributors)—not broadly available like the collective good itself. **Example:** A professional association funds lobbying by offering members exclusive services (credentialing, legal support) unavailable to nonmembers. **Olson pages:** **p. 51** Olson **By-Product Theory and “Special Interests” (pp. 132–135) 17\) Large pressure-group lobbies often arise as by-products of organizations that already have selective incentives Simple explanation:** Many big lobbies exist not because large groups overcame the free-rider problem directly, but because they were attached to organizations that already had coercion or member-only benefits. **Example:** A labor union can lobby effectively because it can sustain membership/resources through mechanisms beyond lobbying alone. **Olson pages:** **pp. 132–133** Olson **18\) Two main sources of selective incentives: coercion or positive inducements (private/noncollective benefits) Simple explanation:** Organizations mobilize large latent groups only when they can compel participation or offer private benefits (“tied” to membership). **Example:** A trade group bundles lobbying with valuable market data and compliance tools that nonmembers cannot access. **Olson pages:** **pp. 133–134** Olson **19\) The “tied sale” logic: bundling a collective good with a noncollective good Simple explanation:** A collective benefit (like lobbying) can be funded by bundling it with excludable benefits that members value enough to pay for. **Example:** A medical association finances advocacy by bundling it with member-only continuing education and certification support. **Olson pages:** **p. 134** Olson **20\) Olson’s preview of how he will apply this to unions, farm organizations, and professional associations Simple explanation:** Olson indicates these groups’ political strength is tied to selective incentives and organizational mechanisms, not mass altruism. **Example:** Farm organizations gain members through cooperative structures and benefits, which then make political activity sustainable. **Olson pages:** **p. 135** Olson **“Forgotten Groups” and Why They Stay Unorganized (pp. 165–167) 21\) Large (latent) groups with common interests often remain unorganized—and therefore politically weak Simple explanation:** Unorganized groups often do nothing; this is not because they lack interests, but because they lack incentives and organization. **Example:** Consumers are numerous and share interests, yet frequently lack lobbying power compared with concentrated producer interests. **Olson pages:** **pp. 165–166** Olson **22\) Even if group gains exceed costs in the aggregate, individuals still will not rationally sacrifice Simple explanation:** Individuals do not expect their contribution to noticeably affect the outcome, so they do not incur private costs for diffuse benefits. **Example:** Individuals do not voluntarily reduce spending to prevent inflation because their personal restraint has negligible effect, while they still benefit if others restrain. **Olson pages:** **p. 166** Olson **23\) Bottom line: small groups or groups with independent selective incentives will organize; large unorganized groups both prove and suffer from the theory Simple explanation:** Organization occurs when groups are small enough or have selective incentives; otherwise, latent groups persist and bear the consequences. **Example:** In global health, small coalitions (or funders with strong incentives) act; broader publics may remain “forgotten,” despite large shared interests. **Olson pages:** **p. 167** |

| [Aaron Friedberg, 2025, “T](https://www.aei.org/articles/the-unraveling-economic-order/)he Unraveling Economic Order,” American Enterprise Institute (8 May) | **Overall Interpretation Central argument:** Globalization is not collapsing because of policy mistakes alone, but because the political foundations that sustained it—hegemonic dominance and shared liberal values—no longer exist. **Policy implication:** The future global economy will likely be fragmented, with competing blocs rather than universal openness, and preserving liberal economic principles will require coordinated action among democratic states. **1\. The Post–Cold War Global Economic Order Is Breaking Down Main point:** The era of deep globalization that followed the Cold War is coming to an end. **Explanation:** Friedberg argues that decades of falling trade and investment barriers are being reversed. Protectionism, trade restrictions, and investment controls are rising, and the highly integrated global economy is fragmenting. The future structure of the international economy is uncertain. **2\. The Breakdown Is Structural, Not Just the Result of Individual Leaders Main point:** The unraveling of globalization cannot be explained simply by personalities such as Donald Trump. **Explanation:** While tariffs and nationalist rhetoric matter, Friedberg stresses that the deeper causes are historical and theoretical. Economic orders depend on power relations between states, not just policy preferences of individual leaders. **3\. Open Economic Orders Depend on a Liberal Hegemon Main point:** Fully open international economic systems are rare and require a dominant liberal power. **Explanation:** Drawing on hegemonic stability theory (associated with Robert Gilpin), Friedberg explains that open systems emerge when one overwhelmingly powerful state supports free trade, absorbs systemic costs, provides liquidity, and protects global commerce militarily. **4\. Liberal Hegemons Create the Conditions for Their Own Decline Main point:** Open economic systems contain the seeds of their own instability. **Explanation:** By spreading capital, technology, and markets, liberal hegemons accelerate the rise of competitors. Over time, uneven growth shifts the balance of power, eroding the hegemon’s relative advantage and willingness to sustain openness. **5\. Declining Hegemons Turn Toward Protection and Conflict Main point:** As hegemonic power erodes, economic disputes intensify. **Explanation:** Domestic industries demand protection, leaders believe others are “free-riding,” and rivals view defensive measures as unfair. Trade conflicts escalate, and integrated systems fracture into rival blocs. **6\. History Shows Repeated Cycles of Globalization and Fragmentation Main point:** The current moment fits a recurring historical pattern. **Explanation:** First globalization (mid-1800s–1914): Led by Britain, ended by World War I. Interwar collapse: Protectionism and economic fragmentation worsened global instability. Post-1945 partial globalization: A Western liberal bloc coexisted with a socialist bloc during the Cold War. Post–Cold War globalization: A short-lived attempt at full global integration that is now unraveling. **7\. The Post–Cold War Bet on China Failed Main point:** Incorporating China into the global economy did not liberalize it. **Explanation:** Many Western policymakers expected market integration to produce political and economic convergence. Instead, **China** retained illiberal economic practices while gaining immense industrial power. **8\. China’s Rise Has Undermined the Liberal Trading System Main point:** China’s economic behavior has destabilized the global system. **Explanation:** Friedberg highlights subsidies, market distortions, intellectual property theft, and export surges that threaten industries worldwide. Existing dispute-resolution mechanisms have failed to contain these practices. **9\. Economic Interdependence Has Become a Strategic Weapon Main point:** Global integration now creates security risks. **Explanation:** Both the **United States** and China fear “weaponized interdependence,” prompting efforts to restructure supply chains, restrict technology flows, and reduce mutual vulnerabilities. This accelerates economic decoupling. **10\. The United States Faces a Strategic Choice Main point:** America must choose between isolation and partial openness. **Explanation:** Friedberg argues the U.S. can either retreat into protectionism or rebuild a **partial liberal economic order** with like-minded democracies—similar to the Cold War Western bloc. The latter is presented as the only viable path. **11\. Preserving a Liberal Order Requires Excluding Illiberal Powers Main point:** China cannot remain fully embedded in a liberal economic system. **Explanation:** Unlike the Soviet Union, China is deeply integrated into global markets. Friedberg contends that defending a liberal order now requires actively **excluding or “extruding” China** from core economic networks among democracies.  |  |
| [Bill Gates, 2025, “Three toug](https://www.gatesnotes.com/home/home-page-topic/reader/three-tough-truths-about-climate)h truths about climate,” GatesNotes (27 Oct) | **1\. Barry Diller Is a Pivotal but Underappreciated Media Figure Main point:** The article (which is a book review) introduces *Who Knew*, the memoir of **Barry Diller**, as the life story of a transformative media and entertainment leader. **Explanation:** Bill Gates emphasizes that even if readers don’t immediately recognize Diller’s name, they will recognize the industries and innovations he shaped, indicating his broad but often unseen influence in media and tech. **2\. Diller’s Early Life Was Complicated and Formative Main point:** Diller’s childhood and personal struggles helped shape his later professional instincts. **Explanation:** The memoir reveals a difficult family life, including a sibling’s addiction and emotional obstacles related to his sexuality growing up, which influenced how he learned to read people and navigate pressure. These early experiences later translated into his business acumen. **3\. Diller Learned from the Ground Up in the Industry Main point:** Diller intentionally spent time learning the fundamentals of the entertainment business. **Explanation:** Starting in a mailroom at age 19, Diller studied contracts and deal memos, gaining a deep understanding of how the industry actually worked. This foundational knowledge gave him an edge over peers who took more conventional career paths. **4\. He Innovated in Television and Film Programming Main point:** Diller created new formats that reshaped entertainment. **Explanation:** At **ABC**, he developed the **made-for-TV movie** and later the **miniseries**, innovations that dramatically increased original TV content. His leadership signaled a shift toward serialized storytelling and expanded television programming beyond traditional formats. **5\. Leadership at Paramount and Fox Demonstrated Creative Strategy Main point:** Diller’s strategic leadership revitalized established media entities. **Explanation:** At **Paramount Pictures**, he rebuilt the studio into the top-performing one by fostering a culture of **creative conflict**—rigorous internal critique of ideas to ensure excellence. His vision also helped create the **Fox Broadcasting Network** as a fourth major U.S. television network, defying conventional wisdom of the time. **6\. He Saw Opportunities Others Overlooked Main point:** Diller anticipated digital trends early. **Explanation:** Transitioning from traditional media, he embraced **interactive and internet-based commerce**, such as turning **QVC into a commerce powerhouse** and later driving early successes in travel and online platforms like **Expedia, Match.com, Ticketmaster, and Vimeo**. His ability to identify and act on innovation ahead of peers is a recurring theme. **7\. The Memoir Balances Success with Honest Self-Reflection Main point:** The book does not gloss over failures or luck in success. **Explanation:** Gates notes that Diller candidly discusses mistakes—like failed bids and missteps—and even attributes some success to luck and timing. This honesty makes the memoir more compelling and instructive. **Summary** The Gates Notes article about *Who Knew* highlights the remarkable but often underrecognized career of **Barry Diller**, whose innovations helped shape modern media and digital commerce. Through candid storytelling about his complicated personal background and strategic immersion in entertainment business fundamentals, Diller’s memoir illustrates how deep industry understanding, creative risk-taking, and early adoption of disruptive technologies can drive lasting influence. Gates recommends the book as a rich example of how visionary leadership and industry foresight—combined with self-awareness about failure and luck—produce a legacy of innovation across multiple sectors.  |  |
|  | Some key questions to consider as you read the case study and think about how the theory applies (or not): o Over decades, across Democrat and Republican administrations, the US has played a central role investing in schemes to protect global health. That includes vaccine programs and economic development programs. One of the most successful of these, focused on AIDS, is called PEPFAR. Democrats and Republicans, alike, mostly loved it. o Why would the US invest its own money in helping other countries improve public health? o Why would the US build a program like PEPFAR more or less “alone” rather than first setting up a global committee to do the work? o As the international order unravels—in part because of changes inside the US—how does that affect the incentives, ability and willingness of the US to sustain programs like PEPFAR? o If a big country like the US walks away, will other actors just step in to fill the void---other countries or, perhaps, wealthy philanthropists like Bill Gates? If it gets harder for a big country like the US to invest in global public health, should philanthropists shift their efforts to pick up the slack  | Why would the US invest its own money in helping other countries improve public health? Self-protection against cross-border disease risk Infectious diseases travel via trade and mobility; reducing outbreaks abroad lowers the probability of importation and costly domestic responses. Geopolitical influence and “soft power” Health programs generate goodwill, strengthen diplomatic relationships, and increase U.S. credibility—often in regions where strategic competition is high. Stability and security externalities Epidemics weaken states, damage economies, increase migration pressures, and can exacerbate conflict. Health aid is a preventive investment in international stability. Economic interests Healthier societies are better trading partners and more reliable markets. Programs often also create demand for U.S.-linked technologies, services, and partnerships. Normative/values-based motives and domestic politics Humanitarian commitments resonate with religious organizations, advocacy groups, and bipartisan coalitions; they can be politically durable when framed as both moral and strategic. Why would the US build a program like PEPFAR more or less “alone” rather than first setting up a global committee to do the work? Speed and decisiveness A single lead actor can mobilize resources quickly. Multilateral committees often require consensus-building that delays implementation—costly during epidemics. Control over design, standards, and accountability Operating “alone” allows the U.S. to set measurable targets, procurement rules, reporting requirements, and monitoring systems without dilution through compromise. Credible commitment As the international order unravels—in part because of changes inside the US—how does that affect the incentives, ability and willingness of the US to sustain programs like PEPFAR? Incentives shift from global goods to domestic distribution When domestic politics become more polarized and economically anxious, voters and elites often prioritize visible domestic spending over diffuse foreign benefits. **Fiscal constraints and contested budgets** Rising deficits and political pressure to cut spending make foreign assistance easier to target than entitlement programs, even if aid is comparatively small. **Declining hegemonic confidence** Friedberg’s framework implies: as relative power erodes, the hegemon becomes less willing to absorb the costs of maintaining open, cooperative systems—health aid included.  |

Americans Share Broad Economic Priorities Main point:** Inflation and cost of living were the top concerns for virtually all Americans in 2024\. **Explanation:** Across race, class, gender, geography, age, and party, inflation ranked first. This establishes a baseline of shared priorities and undermines claims that the electorate is deeply divided on what matters most. **2\. Democratic Voters’ Priorities Are Closer to the Public Than Commonly Believed Main point:** Democratic voters prioritize economic issues more than the public realizes. **Explanation:** After inflation, Democrats ranked health care, abortion, and the economy highly—suggesting a mixed agenda that includes but is not dominated by social issues. This contradicts the popular narrative that Democrats are primarily focused on cultural or identity-based politics. **3\. Republicans’ Priorities Are Perceived More Accurately Than Democrats Main point:** Americans are better at identifying what Republicans care about than what Democrats care about. **Explanation:** Respondents across parties correctly identified economic issues and immigration as top Republican priorities. This asymmetry suggests a communications or branding problem unique to Democrats rather than general voter confusion. **4\. Democrats Are Systematically Misperceived as Social-Issue–Focused Main point:** Americans vastly overestimate how much Democrats prioritize progressive social issues. **Explanation:** Abortion was overestimated as Democrats’ top priority by about 20 percentage points, and transgender policy—ranked 14th by Democrats—was perceived as their second-highest priority. Even Democrats themselves shared some of these misperceptions, indicating internal confusion. **5\. Vocal Activist Groups Distort Party Perceptions Main point:** Small but loud activist factions disproportionately shape how parties are perceived. **Explanation:** Drawing on earlier research by **More in Common**, the authors show that “Progressive Activists” drive much of the national conversation on the left, even though their priorities diverge from those of average Democrats. This dynamic mirrors collective action problems, where intense minorities dominate discourse. **6\. Asymmetry Between the Parties Magnifies the Cost for Democrats Main point:** The Democratic Party pays a higher price for activist misalignment than Republicans do. **Explanation:** Progressive Activists are much less focused on the economy than typical Democrats, while “Devoted Conservatives” align more closely with average Republicans. This makes it easier for Republicans to be accurately understood and harder for Democrats to project a mainstream image. **7\. Transgender Policy Became a Symbolic Vulnerability Main point:** Transgender issues became disproportionately associated with Democrats despite low internal salience. **Explanation:** Neither average Democrats nor Progressive Activists ranked transgender policy highly, yet it dominated perceptions. The authors suggest this resulted from: Advocacy groups emphasizing niche positions. Highly effective Republican messaging, especially Trump campaign ads tying Democrats to unpopular policy stances. Democratic candidates’ reluctance or inability to clearly distance themselves from these issues. **8\. Elections Are Fought Over Perceptions, Not Just Policies Main point:** Democrats lost the “definition battle” in 2024\. **Explanation:** Despite massive spending, Democrats failed to convince voters that they shared their economic concerns. Republicans successfully defined Democrats’ agenda as culturally extreme, reinforcing existing misperceptions.  | **Summary** “The Perception Gap That Explains American Politics” argues that a major reason Democrats struggled electorally in 2024 is not a mismatch between Democratic voters’ priorities and those of the broader public, but a **widespread misperception** of what Democrats care about. Survey data show that Americans across nearly all demographic groups prioritize economic concerns—especially inflation—above all else, and Democratic voters largely share those priorities. However, Americans mistakenly believe that Democrats focus primarily on progressive social issues, particularly abortion and transgender policy, while underestimating Democrats’ concern for the economy. This perception gap, amplified by activist voices and political attacks, allowed Republicans to define Democrats’ agenda more effectively than Democrats could themselves.  |

# Class 5 Delegation and Principal-Agent Theory

| Readings | Notes | Summary |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Reading: Roderick Kiewiet and Mathew McCubbins, “Delegation and Agency Problems,” in The Logic of Delegation, University of Chicago Press, 1991, chapter 2\.  | **1\. Collective Action Is Unavoidable in Large Legislatures Main point:** Congress cannot function without delegation. **Explanation:** As policy domains and budget size expand (from under $1 million in 1789 to over $1 trillion by the 1990s), no individual legislator can acquire sufficient expertise. Collective decision-making requires specialization, which necessitates delegation. **Key insight:** Delegation is a *solution* to collective action problems, not a failure of democracy. **2\. Delegation Creates Principal–Agent Problems Main point:** Delegation introduces risks of agency loss. **Explanation:** Agents often possess information unavailable or costly for principals to obtain (information asymmetry). This creates: **Adverse selection** (hidden traits: competence, effort) **Moral hazard** (hidden actions: shirking, policy drift) **Example:** Bureaucrats know true service delivery costs better than legislators. **3\. Information Is Costly and Politically Distorting Main point:** Perfect monitoring is impossible and inefficient. **Explanation:** Requiring full information reporting can: Divert effort from substantive work Incentivize strategic reporting rather than performance **Institutional response:** Principals prefer *coarsened* information—summary indicators rather than exhaustive disclosure. **4\. Incentives Matter More Than Intentions Main point:** Good agents still respond to incentives. **Explanation:** Even well-meaning agents may shade reports, prioritize visible tasks, or game metrics if incentives reward those behaviors. **Policy implication:** Oversight must focus on **structural incentives**, not moral expectations. **5\. Profit-Sharing and Output-Based Pay Are Dangerous in Public Policy Main point:** Market-style contracts often fail in government settings. **Explanation:** While profit-sharing can reduce agency loss in theory, public policy outputs are hard to measure. Incentivizing agents with residual claims can distort behavior (e.g., tax farming). **Historical example:** Tax farming was abandoned because it encouraged abuse and inefficiency. **6\. Committees and Bureaucracies as Information Filters Main point:** Delegation structures shape what information reaches principals. **Explanation:** Committees act as gatekeepers, revealing some information while withholding other details. This is not accidental—it reflects institutional incentives. **Connection to Congress:** Oversight hearings, audits, and investigations are tools to reduce (not eliminate) information asymmetry. **7\. Delegation Is About Control, Not Trust Main point:** Delegation persists because it is *controlled* delegation. **Explanation:** Congress designs institutions with: Screening (selection mechanisms) Monitoring (reports, hearings, audits) Sanctions (budget cuts, dismissal, restructuring) **Key claim:** Delegation works when principals can credibly threaten punishment. **Connection to Collective Action (Big Picture) Why Delegation Solves Collective Action Problems** Collective bodies struggle with: Free-riding Information overload Coordination failure Delegation allows: Specialization Agenda-setting Policy continuity **Why Delegation Never Fully Solves Them** Agents pursue their own interests Information asymmetry persists Monitoring is costly and imperfect ➡ **Delegation trades one collective action problem for a manageable agency problem. WAYS TO MITIGATE AGENCY PROBLEMS 1\.  Screening and Selection (Ex Ante Controls)** Idea: Choose agents carefully before delegating. How it works: Appointing people with aligned preferences Using confirmation processes, qualifications, or reputation Logic: If agents already share the principal’s goals, less monitoring is needed later. Limitation: Screening is imperfect because true preferences and competence are often hidden. **2\.  Monitoring and Reporting (Information Gathering)** Idea: Reduce information asymmetry by observing agent behavior. How it works: Reports, audits, hearings, inspections, performance metrics Logic: Better information allows principals to detect shirking or drift. Limitation: Monitoring is costly, incomplete, and can distort behavior (agents game metrics). **3\.  Incentive Alignment (Rewards and Sanctions)** Idea: Structure incentives so agents benefit from doing what principals want. How it works: Budget increases or cuts Promotions, reappointment, punishment, dismissal Logic: Agents act strategically; incentives shape behavior even when monitoring is imperfect. Limitation: Outputs are hard to measure in public policy, so incentives can misfire. **4\.  Institutional Constraints and Rules (Structural Controls)** Idea: Limit discretion so agents cannot easily deviate. How it works: Detailed statutes Procedural requirements Jurisdictional limits and veto$ points Logic: Fewer choices reduce opportunities for agency loss. Limitation: Too many constraints reduce flexibility and effectiveness.  | Kiewiet and McCubbins argue that delegation—especially in Congress—is not a sign of abdication but a **strategic response to collective action problems**. Legislators face severe constraints on time, information, and coordination as policy complexity grows. To manage these constraints, principals (Congress) delegate authority to agents (committees, bureaucracies) while designing oversight mechanisms to control agency loss. Delegation allows collective institutions to function, but it inevitably creates information asymmetries and incentive conflicts that must be mitigated through screening, monitoring, and institutional design. **Main Argument of Kiewiet & McCubbins** Kiewiet and McCubbins argue that delegation in democratic government is not a failure of legislative responsibility but a rational and necessary response to collective action and information problems. Legislatures delegate authority to committees and bureaucracies because modern governance is too complex for legislators to manage directly. However, delegation creates principal–agent problems, since agents have different incentives and superior information. The central challenge of democratic governance, therefore, is not whether to delegate, but how to design institutions that allow principals to control agents despite information asymmetries. Kiewiet and McCubbins show that modern government works only because legislators strategically delegate authority, accepting some loss of control in exchange for the ability to govern complex policy systems at all.  |
| Case Study: Are Militaries good at predicting and steering technological change? The risk of drones  |  |  |
| [Noah Smith, “How Chinese drones could defeat America,” Noah pinion](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/71383/files/folder/Readings/Class%205%20Delegation%20and%20Principal-Agent%20Theory?preview=16835764) [Substack (3 June).

How would you know if the military is performing adequately?** From Smith’s perspective, Congress cannot rely solely on traditional metrics like budget size, number of platforms, or global presence. Instead, legislators would need to evaluate: **Adaptation to technological change**: Is the military reallocating resources away from vulnerable legacy systems and toward resilient, distributed, and inexpensive technologies like drones? **Industrial capacity indicators**: Does the U.S. have the ability to rapidly produce drones, batteries, and key components at scale during a conflict? **Wargaming and stress tests**: Are realistic simulations showing that U.S. forces can survive and fight effectively against mass drone attacks, similar to those seen in Ukraine?Failure on these dimensions would indicate that the military is not doing “enough” or is doing the wrong things, even if spending remains high **2\. What mechanisms could help Congress evaluate and improve military performance?** Smith’s analysis implies several oversight mechanisms that would help: **Independent technological audits**: External reviews focused on vulnerability to cheap, asymmetric technologies rather than internal Pentagon self-assessments. **Budgetary conditionality**: Tying funding to demonstrated progress in drone deployment, counter-drone defenses, and domestic manufacturing capacity. **Industrial policy coordination**: Oversight hearings linking defense readiness to civilian industries (batteries, EVs, magnets), recognizing that military power now depends on supply chains outside the Pentagon. **Operational transparency**: Requiring the Department of Defense to publicly explain how it plans to defend high-value assets against low-cost swarm attacks. These mechanisms reduce information asymmetries between Congress and the military and force adaptation before catastrophe occurs **3\. Which mechanisms could hurt effective oversight or performance?** Smith also highlights mechanisms that would undermine Congress’s ability to judge or improve military effectiveness: **Platform-focused budgeting**: Continuing to evaluate success by the number of ships, jets, or tanks encourages investment in increasingly fragile systems. **Cultural and ideological bias**: Treating batteries, EVs, and industrial policy as “culture war” issues rather than national security necessities distorts oversight. **Overreliance on classified assurances**: Excessive secrecy allows military leaders to reassure Congress without confronting structural weaknesses. **Fragmented responsibility**: Separating defense oversight from industrial and economic policy obscures the fact that modern warfare depends on civilian manufacturing capacity. These mechanisms allow inertia and legacy interests to persist, much like the battleship advocates Smith describes in his historical analogy **Bottom Line** Using Smith’s framework, effective congressional oversight requires shifting from measuring military strength by *size and spending* to measuring it by *adaptability, resilience, and production capacity*. Congress must focus less on trusting institutional confidence and more on whether the military—and the broader economy that supports it—is prepared for a radically different kind of war.  | Smith argues that the United States faces a looming military vulnerability because it is organized around large, expensive, and scarce weapons platforms (aircraft carriers, stealth fighters, tanks) that are increasingly vulnerable to cheap, mass-produced drones. Drawing on historical analogies from World War II—especially the sudden obsolescence of battleships—he shows how technological revolutions can rapidly invalidate existing military doctrines. The Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian bombers illustrate how low-cost, battery-powered FPV drones can destroy extremely valuable military assets and reshape modern warfare. Smith emphasizes that the U.S. is structurally unprepared for this shift because it lacks domestic manufacturing capacity in key inputs such as batteries, rare earth magnets, injection molding, and mass drone production. He concludes that political resistance to industrial policy, especially policies supporting batteries and electric vehicles, undermines U.S. national security by preventing adaptation to this new military reality |
| Case Study: Abuses in providing medical care |  |  |
| [Jessica Silver-Greenberg, Sarah Kliff and Aimee Ortiz. "A Famed Hospital](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/07/business/bariatric-surgery-bellevue-hospital.html) [Churns Poor Patients Through Weight-Loss](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/07/business/bariatric-surgery-bellevue-hospital.html) Surgery." NY Times (Dec. 7, 2023\)  | **II. Policy and Delegation Questions — Analysis 1\. Who chooses whether Medicaid eligibility is expanded, and who bears the costs? Who chooses**: Medicaid eligibility is jointly shaped by **federal law** and **state governments**. States decide whether to expand Medicaid under federal frameworks (e.g., ACA expansion). **Who bears costs**: Costs are shared, but heavily **borne by taxpayers**, especially federal taxpayers. The Bellevue case shows that once eligibility exists, **implementation choices** by hospitals can dramatically affect spending without additional legislative action Silver-Greenberg **2\. Who chooses which treatments or procedures are covered by Medicaid? Formal decision-makers**: Federal CMS rules, state Medicaid agencies, and professional guidelines define covered services. **De facto decision-makers**: Hospitals and providers decide **how aggressively** to use covered procedures. Bellevue exploited an area where a treatment was covered but loosely constrained, effectively choosing volume levels itself. **Key insight**: Coverage ≠ control over use. **3\. What delegation problems do these articles illustrate?** The article illustrates classic **principal–agent problems**: **Misaligned incentives**: Policymakers (principals) want cost-effective, safe care. Providers (agents) respond to financial incentives to increase volume. **Information asymmetry**: Regulators rely on hospital-reported data that omits long-term harm. **Moral hazard**: Hospitals take on riskier patients because Medicaid absorbs costs and patients lack alternatives. **Goal displacement**: Targets (number of surgeries) replace underlying goals (patient health). **4\. How would organizations responsible for implementing health care policies know whether people inside their organizations are doing a good job?** Effective mechanisms **missing or weak at Bellevue** include: **Outcome-based metrics** Long-term health outcomes, readmissions beyond 30 days, quality of life measures. **Independent audits** External chart reviews and patient interviews, not just internal reporting. **Process monitoring** Verification that eligibility criteria, counseling, and consent procedures are followed. **Incentive alignment** Salary or quality-based pay rather than volume-based compensation. At Bellevue, reliance on narrow metrics and internal data created **false confidence** in performance **5\. How would the country, as a whole, know if the system is working?** At the national level, this requires: **Independent data collection** National patient registries and claims data tracking long-term outcomes. **Comparative benchmarking** Comparing hospitals across regions for complication rates, patient selection, and costs. **Transparency** Public reporting that includes downstream harms, not just short-term success rates. **Institutional checks** Investigative journalism (as in this case), inspectors general, and legislative oversight. **Key lesson**:When Congress and agencies delegate implementation to hospitals and professionals without strong monitoring, **systemic failures can persist even in well-intentioned programs like Medicaid**. | **I. Summary of the Article (Main Points Explained) High-volume bariatric surgery program at Bellevue Hospital** Bellevue, a public hospital serving largely poor and Medicaid patients, performs an extraordinarily high number of weight-loss surgeries—around 3,000 per year—far more than comparable hospitals Silver-Greenberg. Bariatric surgery is lucrative under Medicaid reimbursement, generating at least $11,000 per surgery and tens of millions of dollars annually for the hospital. **Financial incentives shape medical behavior** Surgeons are paid partly based on volume, creating incentives to maximize the number of operations rather than prioritize patient readiness or safety. Internal pressure emphasizes speed and throughput (“hitting targets”) rather than clinical judgment. **Shortcuts in screening and informed consent** Patients are rushed through approval processes that normally take months. Mental health screenings are sometimes cursory; some patients report not understanding the risks or even the type of surgery they received. Surgeries were allegedly performed on patients who did not meet standard medical eligibility criteria, including prisoners unlikely to maintain post-surgery diets Silver-Greenberg. **Patient harm and system crowd-out** Some patients experienced severe complications, long-term harm, or death. The bariatric program crowded out urgent care (e.g., trauma cases delayed because operating rooms were occupied). Official quality metrics understate harm by excluding long-term complications and relying on hospital-reported data. **Weak oversight and misleading performance signals** Accreditation reviews and public reporting relied heavily on Bellevue’s own data. Oversight bodies and payers (Medicaid) did not effectively detect or deter problematic practices. **III. Bottom Line (Conceptual Takeaway)** The Bellevue case shows how **delegation without aligned incentives or robust oversight** allows implementers to redefine success in ways that undermine public goals. Medicaid did not fail because of legislative intent, but because **the agents charged with implementation optimized for revenue and volume rather than patient welfare**, exploiting information gaps and weak accountability structures.  |

| Electoral Democracy I: Parties and Legislatures |  |  |
| [Case Study:](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-09-09/mexicos-economy-is-quaking-at-the-prospect-of-a-sweeping-judicial-reform-why-is-amlo-pushing-it) Why did Mexico’s former President overhaul the judicial system before leaving office? | **Why Push a Judicial Overhaul During a “Safe” Transfer of Power?** The transition from Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) to Claudia Sheinbaum is unusually secure: Same political party (Morena) Loyal successor Landslide electoral victory High outgoing approval ratings This safety creates a **narrow but powerful window** for institutional change. AMLO pushes the overhaul because: Courts have repeatedly blocked or constrained his policies. He views the judiciary as an **unelected veto player** serving economic elites. Morena’s post-election supermajority suddenly makes constitutional reform feasible. The timing reflects **strategic exploitation of temporary dominance**, not uncertainty or desperation. AMLO is acting while: He still controls the agenda Party discipline is strongest Political costs can be shifted to his successor **Why Target the Judiciary Specifically?** Courts represent the **last autonomous institution** capable of constraining the executive. AMLO has already weakened: Electoral authorities Transparency institutions Independent regulators The judiciary Struck down prior executive initiatives Represents a durable check beyond electoral cycles By mandating popular elections for judges: Judicial independence is replaced with political accountability Judges become vulnerable to party machines, donors, and criminal organizations The reform reframes power as “popular” while **removing insulation from politics**. **What Does This Tell Us About the Role of the Party?** Morena functions as a **highly centralized, leader-driven party**, not an autonomous institution. The party: Controls Congress Controls most state governments Aligns legislatively behind AMLO even at high systemic cost Party discipline enables: Rapid constitutional change Minimal internal resistance Suppression of dissenting factions The party is acting less as a deliberative body and more as a **vehicle for executive agenda control**. **What Does This Tell Us About Party Cohesion?** Morena’s cohesion is **personalistic**, not programmatic: Unity flows from loyalty to AMLO Not from consensus on institutional design Evidence: Even supporters and allies warn the reform may damage Sheinbaum’s presidency Yet party members continue backing it The party prioritizes: Short-term agenda success Over long-term institutional stability This suggests: High cohesion now Potential fragility later, once leadership changes and costs materialize **Broader Political Implications** A “safe” transfer of power can **increase incentives for institutional manipulation**, not reduce them. Strong parties can: Enable democracy Or accelerate democratic erosion when cohesion overrides constraint The case shows: Parties matter not just for governing But for protecting (or dismantling) checks and balances Morena’s behavior resembles: A dominant party using constitutional power to **lock in advantage** rather than compete within neutral rules **Bottom Line** AMLO’s judicial overhaul is not a contradiction of a safe transition—it is a product of it. The episode shows how a cohesive, dominant party can use electoral success to restructure institutions in ways that weaken future accountability. Party strength, when detached from institutional restraint, becomes a tool for **agenda entrenchment rather than democratic governance**. |  |
| Reading: Cox, Gary W. 2008\. “The Organization of Democratic Legislatures.” In The Oxford Handbook of Political Economy.  | **PLENARY TIME IS A COMMON GOOD Why Countries Choose Different Types of Democracies—and the Effects of Those Choices** Countries do not choose presidential, parliamentary, or mixed democratic systems arbitrarily. According to Cox’s framework, institutional choices reflect **how societies try to solve collective action and coordination problems inside legislatures**, especially under conditions of limited time, disagreement, and uncertainty. **Core Reason for Institutional Variation** Different democratic systems reflect different solutions to the same underlying problem: **how to regulate access to scarce legislative decision-making capacity (plenary time) while still producing policy. Presidential systems** (e.g., the United States) separate executive and legislative authority, creating multiple independent veto points. **Parliamentary systems** (e.g., the UK, Germany) fuse executive and legislative authority, often centralizing agenda power in the government. **Semi-presidential systems** mix these logics, often reflecting historical compromises or divided sovereignty. **Effects of These Choices** Systems with **many veto points** (presidentialism, strong bicameralism) tend to be more stable but risk **gridlock**. Systems with **centralized agenda power** (parliamentary governments) tend to be more decisive but risk **policy externalities** (e.g., overspending or exclusion of minorities). Institutional design thus reflects a trade-off between **decisiveness** (acting at all) and **resoluteness** (sticking with decisions). **The Role of Parties in Controlling Agenda and Decisions** In Cox’s account, **political parties are not optional features of democracy—they are functional necessities. Why Parties Exist Inside Legislatures** Parties emerge because: Agenda-setting offices (committee chairs, speakers, ministers) are scarce. Individual legislators cannot secure these offices alone. Parties coordinate members to **control who gets agenda power**. **What Parties Do Allocate agenda-setting authority** (committee seats, leadership positions). **Control access to the floor**, determining which bills are considered and which are blocked. **Reduce uncertainty** by disciplining members and enforcing bargains. Without parties, legislatures would collapse back toward the “state of nature,” where delay dominates action. **What Is the Legislative “State of Nature”?** The legislative state of nature is Cox’s baseline model—a thought experiment describing what legislatures would look like **without institutional rules or agenda control**. **Key Features** All business occurs in the plenary session. Every member has equal and unrestricted access to speak and make motions. Debate is unlimited. Time is scarce. **Consequences Delay is easy; action is hard** (any member can filibuster). The effective decision rule becomes near-unanimity, not majority rule. Logrolling and specialization break down due to lack of trust. Plenary time becomes a **common-pool resource** that is overused. **Why Real Legislatures Move Beyond It** To escape this dysfunction, legislatures: **Curtail individual delay rights**, and **Create unequal agenda-setting power** through offices and parties. This inequality is not a flaw—it is the solution **Connecting the Pieces: Agenda Power as the Central Insight** Cox’s central claim is that **all democratic legislatures evolve institutions to regulate agenda access**. The variation we see across democracies reflects different answers to three core questions: **Who controls the agenda?** (executive, parties, committees) **How centralized is that control? Is agenda power mainly negative (veto) or positive (proposal)?** Different democratic forms embody different answers, producing predictable differences in: Policy productivity Gridlock Spending Party cohesion Minority influence **Bottom Line** Countries choose different democratic forms because: They face different histories, conflicts, and expectations about trust. They make different trade-offs between decisiveness and constraint. They adopt institutional solutions to manage the same fundamental legislative problem: **how to move policy through a crowded agenda under disagreement**. Parties and agenda-setting institutions are the indispensable mechanisms that make democracy governable rather than paralyzed. **COX critique** Political structure could be differing around Lunatics could be in office Outside sources |  |

# 🤔 Electoral Democracy II: Separation of Powers

| Readings | Notes | Summary |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| [Reading:](https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/28345/chapter-abstract/215182597?redirectedFrom=fulltext) Samuels, David. 2009\. “Separation of Powers.” In The Oxford Handbook of Comparative Politics.   | **Core Thesis (Restated Clearly)** Samuels argues that **separation of powers is not just a constitutional feature but a political system that systematically shapes incentives, conflict, and accountability**. Presidential and parliamentary regimes differ not because one is “better,” but because they allocate authority, responsibility, and survival in fundamentally different ways. These differences affect decisiveness, stability, party behavior, executive–legislative relations, and the likelihood of political crisis. **1\. Separation of Powers and Political Incentives Presidential systems** separate the survival of the executive and legislature: Presidents and legislators are elected independently. Neither can easily remove the other. This separation creates **dual democratic legitimacy**, meaning: Both branches can plausibly claim a mandate from voters. Conflicts are harder to resolve institutionally. **Key implication:** Political conflict is not a failure of leadership—it is a predictable outcome of institutional design. **2\. Decisiveness vs. Resoluteness** Samuels emphasizes a core trade-off: **Decisiveness**: the ability to change policy quickly. \- parliamentary **Resoluteness**: the ability to stick with policies once adopted. \- presidential **Presidential Systems** Low decisiveness: Multiple veto points Bicameralism \- multiple houses needing to approve legislation to pass laws Judicial review High resoluteness: policy is firm and structure is firm Policies, once passed, are hard to undo. Fixed terms prevent sudden reversals. **Parliamentary Systems** High decisiveness: The executive controls the legislative majority. Fewer veto points. Lower resoluteness: Governments can fall. Policies may reverse with coalition changes. **Samuels’ insight:** Stability and gridlock are two sides of the same institutional coin. **3\. Executive–Legislative Conflict and Gridlock** In presidential systems, gridlock is most likely when: Presidents lack a legislative majority. Parties are fragmented or weakly disciplined. Unlike parliamentary systems: Executives cannot dissolve the legislature easily. Legislatures cannot remove executives without crisis-level tools (impeachment). **Result:** Policy stalemate becomes the normal condition rather than the exception. Thus president can push a policy into effect when branches cannot agree **4\. Cabinets as a Crucial but Underappreciated Institution** Samuels highlights cabinets as a “missing link” between institutions: **Parliamentary cabinets**: Are partisan and coalition-based. Reflect legislative bargaining. Reinforce party discipline. **Presidential cabinets**: Are often technocratic (a form of governance where decision-making power is held by technical experts) or personal. Do not bind legislators. Provide weaker coordination across branches. **Why this matters:** Cabinets affect how policy priorities move from the executive to the legislature and how accountability is perceived by voters. A cabinet does this through three main mechanisms: agenda control, coalition management, and public attribution of responsibility. **5\. Regime Crises and Democratic Stability** Presidential systems experience: More frequent executive–legislative crises. Higher likelihood of impeachment or forced resignation. These crises are: Often constitutional rather than violent. Still economically and politically costly. **Key point:** Separation of powers does not cause authoritarian breakdown, but it raises the **frequency and intensity of institutional conflict**. **6\. Accountability and Voter Perceptions** Samuels challenges simplistic notions of accountability: Accountability does not depend only on “clarity of responsibility.” Voters often: Attribute responsibility heuristically. Focus on the most visible actor (often the president). Concurrent elections: Tie executive and legislative fortunes together. Reduce ticket-splitting. Increase perceived executive responsibility. **Implication:** Presidents often bear blame even when they lack real governing capacity. **7\. Parties as Conditional Moderators** Separation of powers works differently depending on party systems: Strong, disciplined parties can reduce gridlock. Fragmented parties exacerbate conflict. Party cohesion can: Substitute for institutional coordination. Or magnify conflict if branches are controlled by opposing parties. **This links Samuels to Cox:** Agenda control and party discipline determine whether separation of powers leads to governability or paralysis. **8\. Normative Implication** Samuels does **not** argue that parliamentary systems are superior. Instead, he shows that: Presidentialism prioritizes restraint and stability. Parliamentarism prioritizes action and responsiveness. Democracies choose between these trade-offs based on history, distrust, and expectations of conflict. **Bottom Line (Strong Synthesis)** Samuels shows that separation of powers reshapes political conflict rather than eliminating it. By separating authority and survival, presidential systems trade decisiveness for stability and invite recurring executive–legislative confrontation. Whether this leads to gridlock or governability depends less on constitutional text than on party strength, coalition incentives, and institutional coordination mechanisms.  |  |
| Case Study: Turkey’s conversion to a strong presidential system by referendum | it is easy to see why Erdogan would have wanted strong presidential powers. But why did his party support this shift? Why did the electorate support this shift? |  |
| [Ekim, Sinan and Kemal Kirişci. 2017\.](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-turkish-constitutional-referendum-explained/) “The Turkish constitutional referendum, explained.” Brookings Institution | **What is happening** Turkey is holding a nationwide referendum on a package of 18 constitutional measures that would revise or repeal 76 articles, further reshaping a constitution already heavily amended since 1982 The duties of the prime minister would be subsumed under the office of the president, and the prime ministry would be abolished, transforming the parliamentary system into a presidential one The package is framed as a structural shift from a parliamentary system toward an “executive presidency,” with the changes designed in a way that appears tailored to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and the expectation that he and the AKP will continue winning elections. **LOOPHOLEs** First of all, there would be limits on the scope of presidential decrees: they could not contradict the fundamental and civil rights and responsibilities enshrined in the constitution (*articles 12, 13 and* *section IV*)  Furthermore, the president could not overturn existing laws or decree a law in an issue-area where law by the parliament is required It may seem as if the legislature could then function as a restraining mechanism on the president; yet, it all depends on its composition. A parliamentary session requires 1/3 of its members to be present to make decisions, and needs an absolute majority (50 percent \+ 1\) The general assumption is that, for the foreseeable future, the AKP (Justice and development)  *would* be able to secure an absolute majority **Policy summary** Executive becomes stronger: abolishes the prime ministry; concentrates head-of-state and head-of-government functions in the president; expands decree authority; enables appointment of vice presidents, ministers, senior officials; increases leverage over dissolving parliament and election timing; extends plausible time-in-power horizons under certain snap-election conditions. Legislature loses power: reduces oversight tools (questions limited; no direct scrutiny of president); raises thresholds to override presidential returns of bills; makes impeachment/investigations procedurally harder through high voting thresholds and multi-step review. Judiciary more of a share and political apppintees: increases the share of top judicial bodies effectively shaped by presidential and parliamentary selections, with a strong possibility of alignment with the executive if the president’s party holds large parliamentary majorities. WILL IT PASS?? Neck and neck. Idea of unwillingness to tell true opinion due to oppressive environment **Core recommendations** Treat the shift as a classic power-consolidation package whose real-world constraints depend heavily on parliamentary composition; the same text that preserves “loopholes” (limits on decrees; parliamentary override) also explains why those restraints may not bind if the AKP controls critical seat shares. When explaining “why supporters backed it,” separate (a) partisan incentives (AKP) from (b) voter motivations (electorate) and (c) information environment (media control/intimidation) because the text explicitly flags all three.  | **Evidence-based answers to your questions Why did the AKP support this shift?** Because the amendments materially increase executive control while the text assumes the AKP is likely to keep winning; under that assumption, the party benefits from institutional rules that convert electoral victories into durable, centralized governing capacity (prime ministry abolished; decree power; control of ministries and senior appointments; reduced legislative scrutiny). Because the legislature’s ability to restrain the president is described as contingent on seat share; the article’s “general assumption” that the AKP can secure an absolute majority implies the party expects parliament will not meaningfully check a president from its own ranks, making centralization strategically attractive. Because the package weakens accountability mechanisms that could threaten the leadership (harder overrides; higher impeachment thresholds; curtailed parliamentary questioning; heightened influence over judicial appointments), reducing intra- and inter-branch friction for the governing party. Because the institutional design can prolong incumbency under specific election-trigger scenarios (snap elections and term-structure interactions), which is advantageous to a dominant party aligned with a popular leader. **Why did the electorate support this shift?** The text suggests many voters may support it as a governance model promising decisive leadership and stability (an “executive presidency”) in a context portrayed as politically and socially pressured, where the referendum is framed as historically consequential. The text also flags that voter preferences are shaped under an “oppressive environment,” including intimidation of the “no” campaign, journalists in jail, and media effectively under government control; these conditions can increase perceived legitimacy of the government narrative, reduce the visibility of counterarguments, and chill open opposition (including among undecided voters who may fear expressing “no”). Finally, the polling picture described as “neck-and-neck” with meaningful undecideds implies support is not uniform or overwhelming; rather, whatever “yes” support exists may be a combination of genuine preference for executive centralization plus the effects of constrained campaigning and information asymmetry. |
| READ ALREADY [Kingsley, Patrick. 2017](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/16/world/europe/turkey-referendum-polls-erdogan.html). “Erdogan Claims Vast Powers in Turkey After Narrow Victory in Referendum.” The New York Times.  | **What is happening** Turkey held a national referendum (April 16, 2017\) in which a narrow majority voted **“yes” (51.3%)** to constitutional changes that would significantly expand presidential power; **“no” received 48.7%**. Kingsley The opposition challenged the process, indicating it would seek recounts for a large share of ballot boxes and citing fraud concerns and procedural changes made late in the process. Kingsley The vote occurred under a **state of emergency** after the failed 2016 coup attempt, amid large-scale purges and an environment that watchdogs and observers described as intimidating and uneven for the “no” campaign. Kingsley **Policy summary** The referendum moves Turkey away from a parliamentary system toward a more centralized **executive presidency**, consolidating authority in the presidency. Kingsley Reported core institutional impacts include: **Elimination of the prime minister role**, transferring executive power to the president. Kingsley Expanded presidential powers to **issue decrees** and to **appoint judges and officials** involved in oversight. Kingsley Term-limit structure allowing **two five-year terms**, with a possible third candidacy under certain early-election conditions. Kingsley Greater reach into the civil service (including the ability to order disciplinary inquiries into civil servants, per cited legal analysis). Kingsley Critics argue this weakens **checks and balances** and judicial independence; supporters argue parliamentary majorities could still constrain decrees and influence appointments. Kingsley **Core recommendations Treat the outcome as politically consequential but procedurally contested:** incorporate fraud/recount allegations and “uneven playing field” claims into any external assessment or diplomatic messaging (avoid treating legitimacy questions as settled). Kingsley **Prioritize rule-of-law and institutional safeguards in engagement:** focus on judicial independence, separation-of-powers constraints, and transparency of decree powers as the key risk areas highlighted by critics. Kingsley **Calibrate external strategy to a polarized domestic context:** given the near-even split, avoid policies that assume broad domestic consensus; plan for social volatility and further internal tightening or (less likely) limited liberalization. Kingsley **Monitor near-term signals:** watch for (a) continuation/escalation of purges and repression, (b) any “charm offensive” to rebuild Western ties, and (c) concrete moves such as death-penalty reinstatement rhetoric translating into policy. Kingsley **Evidence Vote margin:** 51.3% “yes” vs. 48.7% “no,” with nearly 99% counted at the time described. Kingsley **Contestation:** opposition intent to request recounts for a substantial portion of ballot boxes; references to complaints and alleged fraud instances. Kingsley **Emergency/purges:** under the state of emergency, the government reportedly fired/suspended \~130,000 people and arrested \~45,000 after the failed coup attempt. Kingsley **Campaign environment:** reporting describes intimidation and constraints on “no” campaigning; observers and analyses cited disproportionate media airtime for the “yes” side and restrictions on election observers. Kingsley **Substance of changes:** abolition of prime minister, decree powers, and expanded appointment authority are explicitly described as part of the new system. Kingsley **Polarization and forward paths:** quotes and analysis suggest heightened division, plus scenarios ranging from outreach to the West to further tightening if outreach is not reciprocated. Kingsley  | **Why did Erdoğan’s party support the shift to strong presidential powers? It legalized (and locked in) the way Erdoğan was already governing.** The article says the “yes” vote *validated* Erdoğan’s leadership style and notes he had been acting as a *de facto* head of government since 2014 despite lacking the constitutional authority for that role. Kingsley **The governing camp argued centralization would improve “state capacity” under crisis conditions.** Backers of the new system claimed a strong, centralized government would better handle major national pressures—economic strain, a large Syrian refugee population, terrorism, conflict with Kurdish insurgents, and spillovers from the Syrian war. **They framed oversight concerns as manageable.** Erdoğan’s supporters denied the reform would eliminate checks, arguing Parliament could override presidential decrees and exert influence over judicial appointments if opposition parties won control. **Party leadership signaled loyalty and continuity.** The prime minister (described as an Erdoğan loyalist) portrayed the result as a step toward “wealth and peace,” and later messaging emphasized intensifying the struggle against “internal and external enemies,” consistent with a securitized, centralized governing approach. **Why did the electorate support this shift? Many “yes” voters appear to have accepted the stability/capacity argument.** The victorious camp explicitly argued that concentrating authority would help Turkey tackle overlapping economic, security, and regional-war challenges. Kingsley **The referendum also functioned as a plebiscite on Erdoğan’s leadership.** The article describes the “yes” vote as a validation of Erdoğan’s leadership style—suggesting personal leadership approval (not just institutional design) drove some support. Kingsley **The information and political environment likely shaped voter behavior.** The piece reports an “atmosphere of fear,” intimidation of opposition members, constraints on “no” campaigning, and disproportionate airtime for the “yes” campaign—conditions that could tilt public support and/or suppress opposition mobilization even if they don’t fully explain it.  |

| Arend Lijphart, “Electoral Systems: Majority and Plurality Methods Versus Proportional Representation.” in Patterns of Democracy. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1999  | **Study Sheet Notes — Class 8 Voting Rules (Lijphart)** **Two-round rule (absolute majority then plurality) Meaning:** Round 1 requires **\>50%** (absolute majority). If nobody gets it, a second round is held where **whoever gets the most votes wins** (plurality), even if \<50%. **Why:** Tries for majority legitimacy first; guarantees a winner in round 2\. **PR (Proportional Representation) Definition:** A system is PR if it aims to make **seat share ≈ vote share**. **Intuition:** 30% of votes → \~30% of seats. **MMP (Mixed-Member Proportional) Core idea:** **Districts pick people; party vote fixes proportions. Two seat types: District/electorate seats:** won by local candidate winners. **List seats:** allocated to “top up” parties so totals match the **party vote**. **Two votes (common):** candidate vote \+ party vote. **List seats vs district seats District seat:** won by being the top candidate in a geographic district. **List seat:** assigned to a party based on party vote entitlement, then filled by candidates from the party’s list. **From party vote % to seats (MMP)** Party vote determines each party’s total seat entitlement. Subtract district seats already won. Remaining seats are filled from the party list (“top-up”). **Thresholds** may exclude very small parties from list seats. **What makes a system PR? Test:** It is designed so that **votes translate into seats proportionally**. **Not automatically PR:** ranked-choice in single-member districts (can still be winner-take-all). **Plurality systems: pros and cons Pros Decisive outcomes:** tends to produce clear winners and often single-party governments. **Simple ballots/counting:** easy to understand and administer. **Clear accountability:** voters can more easily reward/punish a single governing party. **Strong local link:** typically single-member districts, so representation is geographically direct. **Cons Winner-take-all representation:** many voters end up unrepresented in their district. **Disproportional outcomes:** seat shares can diverge sharply from vote shares (seat “bonuses” for large parties). **Strategic voting:** voters may feel pressured to abandon preferred minor candidates to avoid “wasting” votes. **Barriers to smaller parties/minorities:** can suppress representation for dispersed groups. **PR systems: pros and cons Pros Proportionality:** seats more closely match vote shares. **Fewer wasted votes:** even non-plurality preferences can translate into representation. **Inclusion:** improves representation of minorities and smaller parties. **Broad incentives:** parties benefit from appealing beyond narrow geographic pivots. **Cons Coalitions/minority cabinets:** can reduce decisiveness and complicate responsibility attribution. **Complexity:** some PR methods are harder to explain/administer than simple plurality. **Fragmentation risk:** without thresholds, can enable many small parties. **STV (Single Transferable Vote) Proportional ranked-choice** in **multi-member districts**. **Mechanics:** Rank candidates → calculate quota → elect candidates reaching quota → transfer **surplus** votes → eliminate lowest and transfer those votes → repeat until seats filled. **Why “surplus” exists:** candidate already met quota and is elected; extra vote value transfers to next preferences. **Why last-place transfers are ‘fair’:** transfers follow **voters’ next choices**, not a default to 2nd-to-last. **SNTV (Single Non-Transferable Vote) Multi-member district** system where each voter casts **one vote** for one candidate; top N win N seats. **No transfers** and strong incentives for **intra-party vote management**. **District magnitude (DM) DM \= seats per district.** Bigger DM generally makes it easier for smaller parties to win seats under PR, increasing proportionality. **Electoral threshold Definition:** minimum vote share needed for a party to qualify for seat allocation (often list seats in MMP). **Purpose:** limit fragmentation; trade off some proportionality to reduce very small parties. $1- **U.S. (pre-1960s) main idea:** many state legislative maps overrepresented rural areas (smaller rural districts had the same seats as much larger urban districts), diluting urban votes until 1960s reapportionment (malapportioned).$2 **Electoral Disproportionality in Presidential Democracies Balanced executive–legislative systems:** voters may treat the **presidential election as the more important** contest. **Single-winner logic:** because the presidency is a **single office**, the electoral rule is typically **plurality or majority**. **Winner-take-all effect:** the presidential winner can produce a **winner-take-all governing effect**—the winning party may gain outsized governing control/legitimacy compared with its legislative vote share (electoral disproportionality). **U.S. disproportionality point (Lijphart p. 164\) Why U.S. legislative disproportionality is relatively low:** Even though House elections use **single-member, plurality** rules, the **two-party structure** means votes are mostly split between two large parties, so seat outcomes tend to track vote shares more closely than in multi-party plurality contexts (less fragmentation → fewer extreme “seat bonuses” for one party). **Why U.S. presidential disproportionality is high:** The presidency is a **single-winner** contest (plurality/majority logic) and, in the U.S., the **Electoral College** can convert a narrow (or even losing) national popular vote into a decisive electoral-vote win—creating a large mismatch between vote share and “seat” (the office).  |

The cabinet (about **20 ministers**) proposes and directs legislation in their portfolio areas. **Cabinet policy committees** (a smaller group of key ministers) decide most legislative matters, advised by senior career civil servants. **Party leaders control nominations**, creating near “iron-clad” party discipline; backbench legislators almost always pass cabinet decisions. **Collective responsibility:** cabinet members must publicly support cabinet decisions; if they cannot, they resign or are dismissed. Because decisions are made by a small cabinet group, shifts in internal cabinet balance can quickly reverse policy. **3\) Electoral rules under first-past-the-post and their effects FPP plurality in single-member districts:** members of parliament elected by first-past-the-post in \~100 single-member districts. **Disproportionality / manufactured majorities:** plurality SMD can yield seat majorities without majority vote support. **4\) Reform dynamics and legitimacy backlash Process dissatisfaction:** public disgust with how policy decisions were made; declining confidence and turnout. **Electoral reform link:** legitimacy crisis contributed to demand for changing voting rules. **5\) mixed-member proportional design (post-reform) Mixed-member proportional logic:** electorate seats remain; list seats used to bring parties’ total seats close to national party vote shares. **Threshold & exception:** \~5% party-vote threshold; electorate-seat exception can entitle a party to proportional seats even below the threshold. **6\) Predicted incentive shifts under proportional representation/MMP** More parties represented → coalition or minority governments become more common → bargaining incentives change. **Key terms (quick definitions) First-past-the-post:** a plurality system where the candidate with the most votes in a district wins the seat. **Manufactured majority:** a parliamentary seat majority produced without majority vote support. **Mixed-member proportional:** a mixed electoral system that keeps district representatives but adds proportional list seats to make total party seat shares match party vote shares more closely. **Concrete examples from the text (use when a concept feels abstract) Manufactured majorities under first-past-the-post:** In **1978** and **1981**, the Labour Party won a **majority of the popular vote** but did **not** win a legislative majority because its votes were concentrated in urban districts while National narrowly won more rural/suburban seats. **Legitimacy indicators before electoral reform:** Confidence in politicians fell from **33% (1975)** to **4% (1992)**; turnout fell from **86% (1984)** to **76% (1990)**. The **1993 election** was extremely close; National formed a government more than a week after the election with a **one-seat margin**. **Referendum result:** In the **1993 referendum**, voters chose mixed-member proportional representation over single-member districts by **54% to 46%**, widely interpreted as dissatisfaction with the major parties and with how economic reform was implemented. **Policy instability example \+ stabilizers:** Nielson notes that when Labour takes office after National (and vice versa), early cabinet actions can include **overturning core elements** of the previous government’s program; instability is dampened by (1) competition for centrist swing voters and (2) a permanent, meritocratic civil service with agenda-setting leverage. **First elections under mixed-member proportional representation:** The first three elections under the new rules were **1996**, **1999**, and **2002**; the results table illustrates how parties combine **single-seat district wins** with **list seats** to reach total seat entitlements, enabling smaller parties to gain representation. **Why these claims matter (mechanisms and ‘because’ statements) Westminster-style concentration → rapid policy change Because** the executive is drawn from (and usually controls) the legislature: when one party wins a parliamentary majority, its cabinet can usually pass legislation quickly. **Because** New Zealand historically had strong party discipline: backbench members generally support cabinet decisions, so internal cabinet agreement becomes the key bottleneck, not legislative bargaining. **Few veto points → winners have unusually high policy leverage Because** there is no second chamber, executive veto, or strong judicial review in the classic Westminster design described by Nielson, there are fewer institutional “stops” that can slow or block major reforms. **Concrete implication:** elections become higher-stakes and policy can shift rapidly when the governing party changes. **Cabinet committees \+ collective responsibility → centralized agenda-setting Because** cabinet policy committees (a small group of ministers) decide most major legislative matters, policy is made by a small decision-making core rather than by the full legislature. **Because** collective responsibility requires cabinet members to publicly support decisions (or resign), disagreement is resolved internally rather than through open legislative conflict. **First-past-the-post plurality → disproportionality and ‘manufactured majorities’ Because** each district elects one representative, the party that wins many districts narrowly can win many seats even without majority nationwide support. **Concrete example:** 1978 and 1981 show how a party can win more votes overall yet fail to win a legislative majority when its support is geographically concentrated. **Disproportional outcomes \+ concentrated policymaking → legitimacy backlash Because** citizens can observe big policy changes being driven by a party that may not command majority vote support, dissatisfaction can shift from “I dislike this policy” to “the system is unfair.” **Concrete indicators in the text:** confidence in politicians fell from 33% (1975) to 4% (1992); turnout fell from 86% (1984) to 76% (1990). **Why the 1993 referendum matters Because** it shows institutional reform as a political response to system-level dissatisfaction, not just a technical fix. **Concrete fact:** voters chose mixed-member proportional representation over single-member districts by 54% to 46%. **Mixed-member proportional representation → proportional ‘top-up’ logic Because** the party vote determines each party’s overall seat entitlement, list seats can correct distortions created by district-by-district plurality wins. **Concrete implication:** smaller parties can gain representation if they clear the eligibility rule, changing bargaining dynamics and making coalition or minority cabinets more likely. **Threshold \+ electorate-seat exception → balancing proportionality and fragmentation Because** a vote-share threshold limits very small parties from entering parliament too easily, it reduces extreme party fragmentation. **Because** the electorate-seat exception rewards parties with geographically concentrated support, it prevents the threshold from excluding a party that can win at least one local seat. **Predicted incentive shift under proportional representation Because** more parties can win seats, governing often requires bargaining across parties, which changes campaign incentives (broader coalition-building) and governing incentives (negotiation rather than unilateral cabinet control). **Concrete anchor:** the first elections under the new rules were 1996, 1999, and 2002, illustrating how district wins and list seats combine to determine total seats.  |
| Andrew Marantz, 2025, “Is it Happening Here?” The New Yorker (5 May) | **Main claim Democratic erosion often happens through “backsliding”—not tanks in the streets, but a drift toward competitive authoritarianism, where elections continue but core democratic institutions are weakened. Key concept: “legal” subversion Marantz (via Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt) stresses that many anti-democratic moves can be technically legal—approved by legislatures or accepted by courts—and framed as “improving democracy.” Marantz Hungary mechanism (how institutional capture can look “normal”) Viktor Orbán and Fidesz: after 2010, “mostly through legal means,” the party “locked in its power” and reshaped courts/universities/private sector; the country becomes a “hybrid regime” where institutions are “hollowed out from within.” Marantz Media capture is described as plausible deniability: not “we are shutting you down,” but “new owner… improve the business,” with the understood background that the owner is close to the regime. Marantz U.S. comparison: constraints and vulnerability The piece highlights that the “exact steps” of Hungary can’t be copied directly in the U.S. because Hungary’s path depended on a legislative supermajority rewriting its constitution; the U.S. constitutional amendment barrier is much higher. Marantz Still, Marantz quotes a view that U.S. “veto points” (checks that make policy change hard) can be double-edged: they may contribute to frustration, but also constrain executive overreach once an “autocratic threat” exists. Marantz “Normalization” theme (why warning signs don’t always trigger action) Marantz uses the idea that gradual crises can be normalized—people adapt and explain away anomalies, so it can “feel” normal even after things have worsened. Marantz How you can use this in a memo (one sentence): Marantz supplies the macro-level caution: legitimacy stress \+ institutional vulnerabilities can enable rule-bending that stays within formal legality, so reform debates should consider how electoral and institutional design affects democratic guardrails.** |
| Betsy Levy Paluck, 2025, “What a ‘spiral of silence’ can do to a democracy,” The Atlantic (July 1).  | **Main claim A “spiral of silence” happens when people wrongly think they’re in the minority, so they stay quiet; that silence then reinforces the false impression that “nobody agrees with me,” which helps unpopular policies or regimes persist. Paluck Key mechanism (how it works) Perceived risk / sensitivity → people self-censor (offline and online). Paluck People use silence as information (“maybe most people approve of the status quo”). Paluck That misread produces a “false social reality”—a wrong sense of what most people believe. Paluck Concrete evidence Paluck uses Climate opinion misperception: respondents guessed only 43% of Americans worry about climate change, but actual self-reports were 66%. Paluck Similar pattern for climate policies: people guessed 37–43% support, while actual support ranged 66–80%. Paluck Why protests matter (the article’s “so what?”) Protests don’t just pressure leaders; they also signal to ordinary people that they’re not alone, which can interrupt the spiral and update beliefs about public opinion. Paluck Example: after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, Paluck describes research finding that people’s personal abortion beliefs barely changed, but perceptions of what other Americans believed shifted, and the change was linked to exposure to protest/dissent imagery. Paluck She also emphasizes “common knowledge”: public gatherings help people know *what others believe* and know *that others know*. Threat / limitation Paluck flags Protests can backfire if framed as violent or fringe; elites often try to portray protestors as a “vocal minority.” How you can use this in a memo (one sentence): Paluck gives a micro-level legitimacy mechanism—when representation feels mismatched or “pointless,” people may withdraw; when visible signals reveal broader agreement, participation and accountability pressures can rebound.** |

| Case Study: China’s President Xi consolidates political power |  |  |
| Strategic Comments. "Xi’s domestic consolidation of power at the 20th Communist Party Congress."  | **Short summary of the reading** The article argues that Xi Jinping used the Chinese Communist Party’s 20th Party Congress to lock in personal control by appointing loyalists across the top leadership, while signaling a tougher security environment and a more statist, ideology-forward policy direction. It stresses that party congress outcomes are typically “acts of theatre” confirming decisions made in advance, including vetting candidates for “political loyalty.”  The biggest signal of consolidation is personnel: “Xi appointed loyalists,” sidelining alternative networks and reform-minded figures, leading the author to conclude that “Xi is now in total and unchallenged control of the party.”  **1\) Why would Xi consolidate power at the 20th Congress and not earlier? A. Congress timing is the “window” for consolidation** The piece emphasizes that congresses are designed to ratify leadership and constitutional changes already decided, and that candidate selection begins well in advance via investigations into “performance and political loyalty.”  That makes the Party Congress the natural moment to rebuild the top team and formalize a new equilibrium. **B. Xi had more reason to  tighten  control in 2022 than before** The article describes a worsening external environment—“strategic opportunities, risks and challenges are concurrent… uncertainties… rising”—and notes heightened focus on “security” and “economic and technological self-reliance.”  In plain terms: if Xi believes China faces higher external pressure and internal uncertainty, the logic of consolidation is to minimize internal dissent and maximize unity around his line. **C. Personnel consolidation responds to internal elite uncertainty/pushback** Before the congress there was “much talk of pushback” against some Xi policies; the expectation was Xi would need to accommodate other factions.  Instead, he “appointed loyalists” and forced prominent leaders into retirement, reinforcing that the goal was not coalition management but control.  Bottom line: The 20th Congress offered a once-per-cycle mechanism to formalize a third term and reshape the elite team, and the author argues Xi used it to “double down” under rising risk rather than moderate course.  **2\) Where is BDM helpful in explaining this shift?** Here “BDM” is most useful as shorthand for Bruce Bueno de Mesquita’s selectorate theory: leaders stay in power by maintaining a “winning coalition” through loyalty, patronage, and control of elite access. **How the reading fits BDM logic** Elite selection as loyalty screening: the reading highlights investigative teams assessing “political loyalty” of candidates.  In BDM terms, that’s about ensuring the coalition is dependable. Shrinking rivals / replacing alternative power bases: sidelining senior figures and excluding other networks aligns with making top leaders “dependent on Xi’s patronage,” with “none… \[having\] an independent power base.”  This is classic BDM: increase dependency so defection is costly. Discipline and enforcement apparatus: the article underscores the centrality of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and its role enforcing conformity/investigating corruption.  In BDM terms, that’s an enforcement tool that raises the price of disloyalty. What BDM adds: it explains consolidation less as “personality” and more as survival strategy under uncertainty: when threats rise, leaders often prefer a smaller, more loyal coalition even at the expense of broad elite buy-in or technocratic competence. **3\) If advising Xi: where might consolidation fail? Short list \+ why (grounded in the reading) 1\) Economic performance and competence risks** The article describes moves toward “a more statist, distributive economic system,” actions against major companies, and a tougher environment for foreign investors.  Consolidation can fail if loyalty screening crowds out competence and the economy underperforms—especially if “ideology… take\[s\] precedence over… pragmatism.”  **2\) Zero-COVID / social discontent and information brittleness** The Sitong Bridge banner incident and censorship response show latent discontent and heavy repression capacity.  Consolidation can fail if public frustration becomes harder to contain, especially when the state is forced to choose between repression and policy change. **3\) Over-centralization and succession uncertainty** The author notes no clear successor and that Xi may be looking beyond a third term; that creates succession ambiguity.  Highly centralized systems often become fragile when uncertainty rises around leadership continuity (elite incentives shift from performance to positioning). **4\) Security escalation risk (Taiwan / U.S.–China rivalry)** The article highlights sharper threat perceptions (“contain, blockade… maximum pressure”), the emphasis on security, and military modernization goals tied to Taiwan.  Consolidation can fail if a major external crisis produces economic shocks, military setbacks, or elite blame cascades. **5\) Elite resentment—even if fragmented** The author says Xi has “many enemies among China’s elite,” though they are “fragmented, intimidated.”  Consolidation can fail if a shock (economic, public unrest, foreign-policy crisis) gives these actors a coordinating focal point.  |  |
| [Cai Xia, 2021](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-12-04/chinese-communist-party-failed?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email), “The Party that Failed: an insider breaks with Beijing,” Foreign Affairs (Jan/Feb 2021).  | **Short summary of the reading** Cai Xia presents an insider-turned-dissident critique arguing that the Chinese Communist Party has failed as a governing project because it has become a self-protecting elite organization that rules through repression, propaganda control, and personalist power—especially under Xi Jinping. She describes initially hoping Xi would liberalize, then concluding he “was no reformer,” and that the regime has grown “more repressive and dictatorial,” surrounded by a “personality cult,” with diminished space for political speech and civil society. **Core argument and evidence (notes-style) 1\) Why does she say the Party “failed”? Claim:** The Party prioritizes its own control over public welfare and truth, producing cynicism and decay. **Evidence from text:** She describes the system as “a political oligarchy bent on holding on to power through brutality and ruthlessness,” becoming “more repressive and dictatorial,” with a personality cult around Xi and tightening control over ideology and speech. **What it means:** The Party’s legitimacy is no longer grounded in shared belief or responsiveness, but in enforcement and managed narratives. **2\) How does the Party maintain control, in her view? Claim:** Control is maintained through ideology management, propaganda vetting, and internal discipline—rather than open persuasion. **Evidence:** She recounts how “the safest things can be shown on TV” and describes repeated political reviews and vetting to avoid “discrepancy” with propaganda authorities. **What it means:** Even “ideology” is treated as messaging discipline; public discussion is filtered for regime safety, not accuracy. **3\) Why does Xi matter in her story? Claim:** Xi accelerates a shift toward personalist, tighter authoritarianism. **Evidence:** She says the regime “has tightened the party’s grip on ideology and eliminated what little space there was for political speech and civil society,” alongside a personality cult. **What it means:** Compared with a more collective-authoritarian model, personalism increases fear/obedience but can reduce internal feedback and raise brittleness. **Answering the “timing” \+ BDM-style questions (parallel to your previous prompt) A) Why *this* kind of consolidation (or open break) later rather than earlier?** The essay itself provides a timing logic: she frames her break as the endpoint of “a decades-long process” of disillusionment that becomes definitive once Xi’s trajectory is clear and space for dissent collapses. Her argument is basically: earlier ambiguity allowed hope for reform; later, intensified repression and personalism make that hope untenable. **B) Where is BDM helpful in explaining the shift?** If you use “BDM” as **selectorate / political survival** logic, it helps translate her narrative into an incentives story: Xi increases reliance on **loyalty and control of elite access** (propaganda discipline, ideological policing, punishment risks), which raises the cost of defection and narrows acceptable discourse. The essay’s repeated emphasis on tightening ideology and shrinking political space is consistent with a leader prioritizing coalition security over broad responsiveness. **BDM contribution:** consolidation is not just “personality”; it is a survival strategy under perceived threat—stabilizing the winning coalition by increasing loyalty screening and enforcement. **C) If advising Xi: where might consolidation fail? (short list)** Grounded in the dynamics Cai highlights, consolidation is most vulnerable where **information, performance, and elite cohesion** are stressed: **Information failure (echo chamber risk)** If speech/civil society space is eliminated, leaders get worse feedback and make bigger mistakes—especially in crises. (Her emphasis on shrinking space and propaganda discipline implies this risk.) **Elite resentment and opportunistic defection** Personalist systems can unify elites short-term but create long-term fear and resentment; shocks can create coordination points for dissatisfied insiders. (Her “oligarchy” framing and discipline-heavy governance implies latent elite discontent.) **Legitimacy erosion among ordinary citizens** If rule is visibly maintained through coercion and narrative control, public compliance may become more conditional and fragile—especially if economic performance slows. **One-paragraph “analysis take-away” you can use in class** Cai’s essay is best read as an insider critique of authoritarian durability: consolidation and propaganda discipline can create short-run control, but they also raise long-run fragility by restricting truthful feedback, narrowing elite autonomy, and converting legitimacy into managed compliance. In BDM terms, it’s a story of shifting toward a smaller, more loyalty-dependent governing coalition—effective for survival, but riskier under shocks because errors compound when correction mechanisms are weak. |  |
| Case Study: Missing COVID deaths |  |  |
| [James Glanz, Mara Hvistendahl and Agnes Chang.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/15/world/asia/china-covid-death-estimates.html) "How Deadly Was China’s Covid Wave?" NY Times, Feb. 15, 2023  | **Short summary** The New York Times interactive argues that China’s official Covid death toll after ending “zero Covid” (83,150 as of Feb. 9, 2023\) is almost certainly a major undercount. It synthesizes several independent modeling approaches and reports a convergent range: **roughly 1–1.5 million deaths** in the two months after reopening. It explains why precise counting is impossible (missing data, narrow death definition, limited reporting), but concludes the model-based estimates fit observed signals (hospital overload, crematory strain) better than official figures. **Analysis of the reading (how the argument is built) 1\) Central claim** The headline analytical move is to treat the official count as **structurally biased downward**, then triangulate plausible deaths using multiple independent estimation strategies. The article states that “four separate academic teams have converged” on estimates between **one million and 1.5 million** deaths. **2\) Why the official number is likely low (mechanism of undercount)** The article gives three concrete reasons: **Narrow definition of Covid death:** officials initially counted only deaths involving respiratory failure, excluding other causes in infected people (kidney, liver, cardiac failure). **Location bias:** the tally mainly captures **hospital deaths**, excluding people who died at home; the article notes that from 2018–2020 only about **one-fifth** of deaths in China occurred in hospitals. **System overload:** hospitals were “overloaded,” implying hospital deaths are not the full picture and may be a “small proportion” of total deaths during the surge. **Interpretation:** The undercount is not just “bad reporting”—it is baked into definitional and coverage choices. **3\) Evidence strategy: triangulation across models** Instead of relying on one model, the article presents **several estimation pathways** with different assumptions: **Shanghai-outbreak-based model (\~1.6M):** uses Shanghai Omicron dynamics to simulate a national wave after controls are removed; flags that winter seasonality might make this conservative. **Travel-pattern model (\~970k):** adjusts age-specific death patterns and adds Lunar New Year mobility; reports an uncertainty band (simulation bounds). **Testing-sampling retrospective model (\~1.5M; range 1.2–1.7M):** uses continued official sampling after mass testing ended to infer rapid infection spread (about **90% infected** in a bit over a month), then combines timing, fatality rates, and vaccine effects. The authors emphasize uncertainty in how well sampling captured true infections. **Back-of-the-envelope using U.S. fatality rates (\~0.9–1.4M):** assumes China’s infection fatality rate is roughly similar to the U.S. (0.15%) and applies it to plausible infection shares (40–65% infected). **Why this matters:** the article’s credibility rests on *convergence*—different methods point to the same order of magnitude, even though each has limitations. **4\) Uncertainty and missing-data constraints (the article is explicit)** The article repeatedly emphasizes: “without reliable data,” these are “informed guesses” with “significant uncertainty.” Several data streams are missing or degraded: China shut testing centers, made self-reporting voluntary, stopped publishing exact daily death values, and multiple cities stopped publishing cremation totals. **Interpretation:** The piece is careful not to claim precision; it argues that uncertainty is real but not symmetrical—the official number is far outside the plausible range implied by multiple methods. **5\) Political relevance (why counting deaths matters)** The article explicitly links mortality estimates to regime legitimacy claims: Xi portrayed “zero Covid” success as proof of superiority over the West, and a high death toll would undercut that narrative. In other words, mortality becomes a **political-statistical battleground**: counting rules, publication choices, and model-based reconstructions all affect perceptions of performance. **Key takeaway (1–2 sentences)** When official reporting is constrained by narrow definitions and missing data, the most defensible way to estimate crisis outcomes is triangulation: here, several independent models converge on **\~1–1.5 million deaths**, suggesting the official tally is not just slightly wrong but likely off by an order of magnitude. **Notes you can use (study-sheet style) Main finding** Estimated deaths after reopening: **\~1–1.5M** (range), vs official **83,150**. **Why the official count is low** Counts mainly hospital deaths; excludes home deaths. Narrow death definition (respiratory failure focus). Reporting gaps and discontinued data series. **Methods used** Compare to past outbreaks with better data (Shanghai/Hong Kong analogs). Mobility/travel modeling (Lunar New Year spread). National sampling/testing data to infer infection rate. Simple infection fatality rate extrapolation from U.S. benchmark. **What to say if asked “how confident is this?”** Not precise; **uncertainty is acknowledged**, but multiple approaches converge and fit observable strain signals better than the official figure.  |  |
| [Michael Schuman.](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/02/china-million-covid-deaths-communist-party/673177/) "Can a Million Chinese People Die and Nobody Know?" The Atlantic  | **Short summary (3–4 sentences)** Schuman argues that China’s official Covid statistics are unreliable not just because of technical error, but because they serve the political interests of the Chinese Communist Party. He claims experts had to estimate deaths independently, producing ranges around **1–1.5 million** after “zero Covid” ended, far higher than the official total (\~83,000) He frames the core issue as authoritarian information control: even in the smartphone era, censorship and political incentives can make major events hard to measure externally. **Core argument (what the author is really saying)  Official Covid data cannot be trusted because it is politically motivated and produced in a system designed to control information.**  **Supporting claim 1: The “missing million” is plausible under authoritarian secrecy** Schuman says independent experts were “forced to calculate their own estimates,” producing much higher numbers (about **1–1.5 million**) than the government claims.**Interpretation:** the issue is not whether one estimate is perfect—the argument is that the state’s number is not credible given the incentives and control environment. **Supporting claim 2: Modern tech does not automatically produce transparency** He explicitly challenges the assumption that smartphones \+ satellites make cover-ups impossible, arguing the controversy shows “how much control autocratic states still wield over information.” **Mechanisms (how the system hides reality) Mechanism A — Institutional censorship \+ intimidation** He contrasts open societies (constant scrutiny by journalists/activists) with the claim that “no authoritarian state could survive that scrutiny.” Schuman Example of repression: citizen-journalist Zhang Zhan was sentenced to four years for documenting the Wuhan outbreak. Schuman **Simple explanation:** People who would normally report problems are punished, so fewer problems are publicly recorded. **Mechanism B — Partial visibility \+ rapid removal (“glimpses” problem)** Schuman notes that despite the surveillance state, some signals appear (satellite activity at cremation centers; footage of overwhelmed hospitals), but “once detected, such glimpses are quickly removed” by censors. **Simple explanation:** Evidence leaks out, but it doesn’t stay up long enough to become widely shared or systematically measurable. **Mechanism C — Narrative management and memory erasure** He argues the state tries to erase the “zero-COVID” experience itself: the policy was hailed as a “magic weapon,” but the term then vanished from official discourse. **Simple explanation:** If the state rewrites the story, the public record becomes patchy, and later accountability becomes harder. **Mechanism D — The center may not even know the truth (principal–agent problem)** Schuman offers a key twist: Beijing may not have accurate numbers because authoritarian systems without free media struggle to collect reliable information. He quotes Jennifer Pan: authoritarian governments “have trouble gathering reliable and accurate information,” and local governments have incentives to keep bad news from the center to look good for promotion. **Simple explanation:** Local officials “massage” bad information; the top may receive filtered reports. **Implications (why this matters beyond Covid) 1\) Domestic legitimacy risk** Schuman argues the party must promote victory narratives because it cannot admit catastrophe without threatening its image of competence. He also flags a medium-run risk: the gap between what officials say and what citizens observe “could damage the party’s credibility.” **2\) International trust and global spillovers** He ties secrecy to global stakes: the world needs reliable information from China for economics, environment, and security, but often must rely on “scraps of anecdotal evidence” and opaque statements. He also asks: if a government won’t reveal Covid deaths, can it be trusted on other vital data like greenhouse-gas emissions? **Key takeaway (1–2 sentences)** Schuman’s central takeaway is that **authoritarian information control is not only about hiding the public truth—it can also distort what leaders themselves know**, because censorship and career incentives reward underreporting |  |

| Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson, “Economic Backwardness in Political Perspective.” The American Political Science Review, Vol. 100, No. 1  | **1\) Summary** Acemoglu and Robinson argue that some societies stay economically “backward” not because elites lose money from growth, but because **growth can threaten elites’ political control**. Their central mechanism is the **political replacement effect**: new technologies or institutional reforms can create “turbulence” that weakens incumbents’ advantage and raises the chance they are removed. As a result, elites may **block** innovations even when those innovations would raise total national income. **2\) Theory analyzed A. Political replacement effect (core theory)** The paper’s key claim is explicit: elites may block development because innovation “often erode\[s\] elites’ incumbency advantage,” increasing the likelihood they are “replaced.” Acemoglu The deeper logic: “superior institutions and technologies” can reduce elites’ political power, even if they increase economic output. Acemoglu **B. Why “the pie gets bigger” doesn’t solve it (anti–Political Coase Theorem)** They argue you can’t assume winners will compensate losers, because there is “no (credible) way of compensating ex post the political elites who lose their power.” Acemoglu **C. Nonmonotonic effect of political competition** Elites block innovation **only in a middle zone**: when competition exists but elites still have enough power to block—and also fear replacement. The abstract states blocking is “nonmonotonic”: elites are unlikely to block when competition is very high or when they are highly entrenched; blocking is most likely when power is threatened but competition is limited. Acemoglu **D. When blocking is more likely (high stakes / rents)** Blocking is “more likely when political stakes are higher,” e.g., when elites enjoy large rents (like land rents). Acemoglu **E. External threats can reduce blocking** They also claim external threats can push elites toward modernization, because falling behind increases vulnerability. Acemoglu **3\) Simple explanation (plain language) Innovation helps the country**, but it can also **shake up who holds power**. If elites think modernization will create new rivals, protests, or instability that could remove them, they may choose **staying in power over national growth**. So you can end up with a country where leaders deliberately keep bad rules or old technology because it’s politically safer for them—even if it’s economically worse for everyone else. **4\) Evidence in text and example Direct textual evidence (what the authors say)** They define the mechanism clearly: elites may block “technological and institutional development” because of the “political replacement effect.” Acemoglu They explain why: “superior institutions and technologies may reduce their political power and make it more likely that they will be replaced.” Acemoglu They emphasize the tradeoff for elites: innovation can raise output **but** also “increase the likelihood” elites “will lose power.” Acemoglu **Example the paper uses (industrialization in the 19th century)** They use uneven industrialization in Europe to illustrate blocking: Some states “opposed” industrialization because they feared revolution and loss of control—Gerschenkron is quoted saying railroads were seen as “carriers of the dreaded revolution,” and the state became “an obstacle to the economic development of the country.” Acemoglu Russia is used as an example where elites’ fears were “confirmed”: industrialization brought “social turbulence” and culminated in the 1905 Revolution. Acemoglu **“Benchmark” evidence inside the model (what *should* happen)** They show that a social-planner benchmark would always adopt the better technology—“the social planner always innovates.” Acemoglu **Point:** if societies don’t modernize, the authors argue the explanation must be political incentives, not lack of economic gains.  |
| CASE STUDY: Saudi Arabia 30 year plan |  |
|  | **1)Economist The Economist reading (Saudi Arabia \+ sport): summary \+ link to Acemoglu** Summary (what it’s saying): Saudi Arabia is making a major, state-backed push into global sports, saying it supports economic diversification and modernization—while critics argue it’s also reputation management (“sportswashing”). **Key idea(s):** Sports investment is framed as an economic strategy (tourism, new industries, global branding), not just entertainment. It’s also politically sensitive because it highlights how an authoritarian government can pursue modernization while facing criticism about rights and legitimacy.  A central tension is whether these investments create a genuinely competitive private sector—or remain state-driven and dependent on subsidy/patronage. **How it connects to Acemoglu:** This looks like a modern version of what Acemoglu calls “defensive modernization”—elites become more willing to push modernization when they perceive threats from falling behind (economically/strategically). At the same time, Acemoglu’s deeper point is that elites’ core concern is not just money, but whether change erodes their political power. The sports push can be read as modernization that *may* boost growth/soft power while still keeping control centralized (i.e., modernization without fully “opening” political competition).  |
|  | **2)Mati & Rehman (IMF) reading: summary \+ link to Acemoglu Summary (what it’s saying):** Saudi Arabia’s reform program is presented as a real economic transition: reforms aim to reduce oil dependence and strengthen competitiveness, with **non-oil growth accelerating since 2021** and staying near 5% in 2023\. **Key idea(s): Regulatory/legal changes** (entrepreneurship laws, investor protections, lower business costs) are described as drivers of private investment—e.g., **investment deals and licenses rising sharply in 2022**. The state remains a major actor through the **Public Investment Fund**, which is explicitly described as deploying capital to stimulate private-sector investment. The authors warn that sustaining growth requires “reform momentum” \+ sound macro policy, and that large projects must generate real returns; they emphasize **monitoring and evaluation** to reduce risks from targeted industrial policy. **How it connects to Acemoglu:** This reading is basically describing a pathway for **state-led institutional change** that supports investment—consistent with Acemoglu’s argument that elites sometimes allow/encourage modernization when it doesn’t threaten their position (or when threats make modernization necessary). But Acemoglu’s warning lens would ask: do these reforms create broadly shared, independent economic power—or do they remain structured so that elites can maintain political dominance while capturing the gains? The IMF’s emphasis on careful governance/monitoring of state-led interventions also fits that concern.   |
| Case Study: Why Did Authoritarian Indonesia Adopt the Green Revolution Technologies?  |  |
| Temple, Jonathan. 2003\. “Growing into trouble: Indonesia after 1966.” Sections 2,3,7,8 (scan the rest). In In Search of Prosperity. Dani Rodrik, ed. Princeton University Press.  | **1\) Summary (Temple \+ Acemoglu lens) Temple’s core story** is that Indonesia’s “New Order” era (post-1966) produced decades of rapid growth and major poverty reduction, but the same political-institutional setup that enabled coherent policy early on also allowed corruption, weak oversight, and fragile finance to build up—helping turn the 1997–98 shock into a collapse. Temple explicitly frames the crisis as “everything going wrong at once.” Temple **Acemoglu & Robinson’s core theory** explains why elites sometimes **support** growth-enhancing change and sometimes **block** it: innovations can weaken incumbents (“political replacement effect”), and blocking is most likely when **competition is limited but power is threatened**, especially when **political stakes (rents) are high**. Acemoglu **2\) Theory analyzed (Acemoglu & Robinson → what to look for in Temple) A. Political replacement effect (why elites resist reform)** Acemoglu & Robinson: elites may block development because “innovations often erode elites’ incumbency advantage.” Acemoglu **Prediction:** when reforms threaten who stays in power (or who controls rents), elites drag their feet, distort regulation, or pick “safe” growth paths. **B. Non-monotonic competition: blocking is most likely in the “middle”** Blocking is most likely not at the extremes, but “**only when political competition is limited and also when their power is threatened**.” Acemoglu **Prediction:** a regime can run pro-growth policy for a long time, then shift toward rent-protection and weaker institutions once threats rise. **C. High political stakes increase blocking incentives** Blocking is “more likely when political stakes are higher,” including “rents from land and natural resources.” Acemoglu **Prediction:** resource-based rents (and discretion over licensing/credit) increase incentive to politicize the economy. **3\) Simple explanation (one paragraph)** Think of it like this: **growth changes society**—it creates new wealth, new business groups, and new pressures. If the ruling coalition thinks those changes might **reduce its grip on power**, it has a reason to **shape “reform” around protecting itself**, even if that quietly weakens the economy (like lax supervision or political lending). That’s the Acemoglu mechanism. Temple’s Indonesia case shows how a regime can look “successful” for years while building vulnerabilities that only become obvious when a major shock hits. **4\) Evidence in text \+ Indonesia examples (Sections 2, 3, 7, 8\) Section 2 — Indonesia’s growth record: big gains after a collapse Temple’s main point:** Indonesia started in a dire position and then achieved a long growth run after 1966\. **Key evidence (Temple):** Early 1960s collapse: “inflation reached almost **600% in 1965**,” and Indonesia “could no longer meet its debt service obligations.” Temple Growth performance later: “real GDP per capita rose by more than **a factor of four**… poverty… fell from **60%** … to **14%**.” Temple **Indonesia mechanism (how it connects to Acemoglu):** When the regime takes power amid economic breakdown, **adopting stabilization and growth policy can increase legitimacy and resources** (rents) without necessarily threatening incumbency—so elites may *support* growth initially (consistent with elites not always blocking). Temple even suggests Suharto may have viewed growth as a way to “maintain” power. Temple Acemoglu also notes that **external threats can reduce incentives to block**, which fits the idea that crisis conditions can push elites toward “do what works” policy early on. Acemoglu *(This is a theory-to-case alignment; Temple’s text gives the crisis context, Acemoglu gives the mechanism.)*  **Section 3 — Why policy quality was strong (for a long time): stability \+ technocrats \+ discipline Temple’s main point:** early macro policy was unusually orthodox and effective, helped by technocrats and the political capacity to take a long-term view. **Key evidence (Temple):** Stabilization: inflation “near **1500%**” in 1966 fell to “**under 15%**” by 1969\. Temple Personnel: Suharto appointed advisers (including “Berkeley” trained economists) described as “technocrats… in favor of markets and foreign capital,” shaping macro policy for “more than two decades.” Temple Political condition: Suharto’s “secure grip on power enabled a long-term view and… continuity in policy-making.” Temple Constraint mechanism: an “almost completely open” capital account by 1970 may have provided discipline against overvaluation. Temple **Indonesia mechanism (Acemoglu connection):** Acemoglu predicts elites don’t block when either (a) competition is very high or (b) they’re **highly entrenched**. Acemoglu Temple’s description of strong incumbency security helps explain *why* a coherent policy line could persist: the regime wasn’t constantly scrambling to survive next week, so it could implement stabilization. But Temple also notes limits: technocrats had “little influence” on micro policy and could not stop 1970s import substitution and intervention. Temple That fits Acemoglu’s idea that elites accept growth-enhancing policy **until it threatens rents or coalition management**. **Section 7 — Crisis and institutional weakness: growth \+ weak institutions → “crony capitalism” \+ fragile finance Temple’s main point:** the crisis wasn’t just “bad luck”; weak institutions and politicized rent-allocation amplified vulnerability. **Key evidence (Temple):** “institutional weaknesses are a large part of the explanation” of the crisis. Temple Growth interacted with weak institutions, undermining shock resilience; corruption was “highly centralized… integral” to Suharto’s government. Temple Suharto’s rule “almost monarchical,” corruption linked to eliminating political competition; lack of competition let him “engineer streams of rents” to reward allies/family; “few mechanisms” restrained corruption. Temple Financial supervision failures had “political origins”: regulators weren’t always ignorant; “political connections” blocked supervision. Temple **Indonesia mechanism (Acemoglu connection):** This is almost a textbook illustration of Acemoglu’s “political stakes” logic: high discretion and rents (especially in a politicized economy) increase incentives to resist reforms that would reduce control. Acemoglu explicitly says blocking is more likely when political stakes are high, including **natural resource rents**. Acemoglu Temple’s story of **rent streams used to eliminate competition** and the political obstruction of supervision maps onto Acemoglu’s core claim that elites oppose change when it threatens their hold on power—i.e., protecting incumbency advantage can dominate economic efficiency. Acemoglu **Section 8 — “Growing into trouble”: why long growth didn’t guarantee resilience Temple’s main point:** Indonesia’s achievements were real, but the regime’s institutional setup created a “precarious balancing act” that made collapse more likely once conditions turned. **Key evidence (Temple):** After 1997–98, earlier success looks “less than inevitable… a precarious balancing act.” Temple The crisis involved failure to respond effectively partly because corruption and coalition management were built into the political system; corruption helped explain Suharto’s “downfall.” Temple Temple’s broad causal claim: fast growth \+ weak institutions gradually reduced the country’s ability to withstand shock. Temple **Indonesia mechanism (Acemoglu connection):** Acemoglu’s model predicts that when institutions don’t constrain extraction, elites can maintain growth while still creating distortions; but those distortions can become development bottlenecks or crisis multipliers. Acemoglu Temple’s “grow into trouble” framing is consistent with the idea that **the political equilibrium** (who gets rents, how oversight works, how threats are managed) can be stable for a long time—until it isn’t.  |

| Reading: Mathew D. McCubbins and Thomas Schwartz. 1984\. “Congressional Oversight Overlooked: Police Patrols versus Fire Alarms.” American Journal of Political Science, Vol. 28, No. 1, pp. 165-179  | **Main Argument:** what scholars see as a neglect of oversight, they argue that it is a preference for one form of oversight over another LESS EFFECTIVE form **Fire-alarm Vs police patrol oversight** Fire Alarm: involves less active and direct intervention than police patrol. They enable a system of rules, procedures, and informal practices that enable individual citizens and interest groups to examine administrative decisions.  They charge those who violate and seek remedies from agencies, courts, and congress itself Police Patrol: direct surveying of an agency that is labor intensive and time consuming. Reading documents, commissioning scientific studies, conducting field observations, and holding hearings to question officials and citizens affected. **Assumptions of Congress Technological**: two forms of oversight and they can choose either one or form a combination of the two. EX: (1)When writing legislation ,Congress can include police-patrol features, such as sunset review, or fire-alarm features, such as requirements for public hearings. (2)When it evaluates an agency's performance, Congress can either call oversight hearings to patrol for violations of legislative goals or else wait for alarms to signal potential violations **Motivational:** they want credit\! **Institutional**: executive agencies are agents of a congress that provides them with funds.  |
| Plumer reading (VW “clean diesel” scandal | Plumer’s core claim is that Volkswagen exploited predictable, laboratory-based emissions testing to evade regulatory intent at scale—by programming “defeat device” software that detected when a vehicle was being tested and temporarily activated pollution controls, while emitting far more NOx during normal driving. The scandal illustrates a broader regulatory vulnerability: when compliance is assessed through standardized, gameable procedures (and when outside scrutiny is constrained), firms have strong incentives and ample opportunities to cheat. (Plumer, 2015, pp. 1–7) Plumer **Policy ideas implied or stated in Plumer Move from lab-only testing to real-world (on-road) verification** Because fixed lab protocols are predictable and easier to “game,” Plumer points to on-road testing as a way to reduce manipulation and detect discrepancies between lab and real-world emissions. He notes European regulators moving to require on-road testing in addition to lab testing. (Plumer, 2015, pp. 6–7) Plumer **Increase penalties and credible enforcement to change firm incentives** The piece highlights large potential Clean Air Act fines and the possibility of criminal charges, implying deterrence depends on regulators’ ability to impose meaningful costs when cheating is discovered. (Plumer, 2015, pp. 1–2, 7\) Plumer **Enable independent auditing and security research of embedded software** Plumer argues that modern cars’ software complexity creates oversight challenges—and that legal protections over software (he discusses DMCA constraints) can make it harder for independent researchers to scrutinize code and identify manipulation. A policy lever is **creating legal safe harbors/exemptions** for good-faith testing and evaluation. (Plumer, 2015, p. 7\) Plumer **Use “hybrid” compliance regimes: continuous monitoring \+ randomization** While not presented as a formal framework, the logic of the article implies regulators should combine: (a) real-world monitoring, (b) less predictable test protocols, and (c) data transparency—so firms cannot tailor behavior only to known checkpoints. (Plumer, 2015, pp. 6–7) Plumer **How Plumer relates to McCubbins & Schwartz (police patrols vs. fire alarms)** Plumer’s story is almost a textbook example of **why “police-patrol” oversight is limited** and why **fire-alarm oversight becomes pivotal**: **The failure mode in Plumer looks like weak “police patrols”** In McCubbins & Schwartz, police-patrol oversight is centralized, proactive monitoring of agency/regulated behavior. (McCubbins & Schwartz, 1984, p. 166\) McCubbinsSchwartz1984 In Plumer, the analog is regulators relying heavily on standardized lab emissions tests. Because those checks were predictable, they were easier to manipulate—so the “patrol” existed but was systematically evaded. (Plumer, 2015, pp. 6–7) Plumer **Discovery came through a “fire alarm” channel—external actors sounding the alarm** McCubbins & Schwartz define fire-alarm oversight as Congress creating/using systems where **outside parties** (citizens, interest groups, researchers) detect problems and trigger intervention. (McCubbins & Schwartz, 1984, p. 166\) McCubbinsSchwartz1984 Plumer shows the scandal was uncovered by an **independent group (ICCT) working with university researchers** who performed on-road testing and surfaced the discrepancy, which then escalated regulatory action. That is classic “alarm sounding.” (Plumer, 2015, pp. 4–5) Plumer **Plumer’s policy fixes map onto “improving the alarm system”** McCubbins & Schwartz emphasize that fire-alarm systems work when rules/procedures give outsiders access to information, standing, and pathways to force responses. (McCubbins & Schwartz, 1984, pp. 166–168, 173–174) McCubbinsSchwartz1984 Plumer’s discussion of enabling independent scrutiny (e.g., DMCA exemptions) and adding on-road testing strengthens exactly those pathways—more eyes, more real-world evidence, more triggers for enforcement. (Plumer, 2015, pp. 6–7) Plumer **Bottom line connection:** Plumer’s VW case demonstrates how regulated entities can outmaneuver routinized, centralized checks (police patrols), and why effective oversight often depends on empowering decentralized detection and escalation (fire alarms)—then ensuring the state has the capacity and will to respond when alarms go off. (McCubbins & Schwartz, 1984, pp. 166–169; Plumer, 2015, pp. 4–7)  |
| Sui-Lee Wee reading (Mandalay earthquake) | The piece argues that the humanitarian catastrophe in Mandalay is being made materially worse by **state capacity failures and political conditions**: destroyed roads, downed power lines, scarce equipment, and overwhelmed hospitals collide with Myanmar’s ongoing civil war and “repressive military government,” producing slow, improvised rescue operations driven largely by volunteers rather than an effective state-led response. The story emphasizes how, in a disaster, **governance and logistics** can be as life-or-death as the physical shock itself. (Wee, 2025, pp. 2–5) Sui-Lee **Policy ideas implied by the article Build rapid-response operational capacity (equipment \+ trained teams)** Volunteers describe being untrained for earthquake rescues and urgently needing skilled rescuers and heavy machinery (e.g., excavators). Policy implication: invest in professional urban search-and-rescue capacity, staging of equipment, and interoperable emergency protocols. (Wee, 2025, p. 5\) Sui-Lee **Harden critical infrastructure and access corridors** Downed power lines and destroyed roads are described as major constraints on rescue work. Policy implication: prioritize resilient infrastructure, backup power, and pre-planned access routes for emergency logistics. (Wee, 2025, p. 2\) Sui-Lee **Surge health-system capacity and evacuation routing** Mandalay hospitals are overcrowded and unable to accept more patients; ambulances route to Pyin Oo Lwin. Policy implication: disaster surge planning (field hospitals, triage hubs, patient distribution systems). (Wee, 2025, p. 4\) Sui-Lee **Enable and protect decentralized responders (civil society \+ aid groups)** Ordinary people arrive with supplies; doctors affiliated with the Civil Disobedience Movement travel to help; international aid groups rush to disaster sites. Policy implication: create rules that facilitate rapid entry, coordination, and safe operation of non-state responders—especially when the state is politically constrained. (Wee, 2025, pp. 4–5) Sui-Lee **Accountability mechanisms for security forces in disasters** A volunteer alleges soldiers/police “turned up but did nothing,” “hanging around with their guns.” Policy implication: clarify legal duties, command responsibility, and performance monitoring for uniformed services during emergencies. (Wee, 2025, p. 4\) Sui-Lee **How it relates to McCubbins & Schwartz (police patrols vs. fire alarms) This is a “fire-alarm” story about state failure made visible by citizens and journalists** McCubbins & Schwartz argue that fire-alarm oversight relies on outside actors to detect problems and trigger response, rather than continuous centralized monitoring. (McCubbins & Schwartz, 1984, p. 166\) McCubbinsSchwartz1984 Wee’s reporting effectively functions as an alarm: it documents bottlenecks (roads, power, equipment), hospital overload, and alleged non-assistance by security forces—information that can mobilize domestic and international pressure/resources. (Wee, 2025, pp. 2–5) Sui-Lee **It shows why “police patrol” monitoring is insufficient when institutions are weak or politicized** Police patrol oversight presumes routine, proactive supervision by principals. In disasters, that translates to competent emergency management systems. (McCubbins & Schwartz, 1984, pp. 166–167) McCubbinsSchwartz1984 The article describes precisely the opposite: limited equipment, blocked access, overwhelmed hospitals, and governance constraints from conflict and repression—conditions under which centralized supervision and implementation break down. (Wee, 2025, p. 2\) Sui-Lee **Policy implication in McCubbins terms: design stronger “alarm systems” and clearer response channels** McCubbins & Schwartz emphasize that effective fire alarms depend on procedures that let actors raise complaints and force attention. (McCubbins & Schwartz, 1984, pp. 166–168) McCubbinsSchwartz1984 Wee’s narrative highlights the functional substitutes for weak patrols: volunteer mobilization, resistance-linked medical networks, and international aid. The governance design question is how to institutionalize those channels (information flow, access, coordination) so alarms reliably translate into action—even under political fragmentation.
