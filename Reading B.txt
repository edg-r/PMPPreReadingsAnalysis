Listen to this story 
“TRISTEZA NÃO tem fim, felicidade sim.” Sadness has no end, though 
happiness does. The line, immortalised in a bossa nova song made 
famous by the film “Black Orpheus”, captures how joy can be fragile, 
fleeting and precious.

For a few extraordinary hours on January 3rd, Venezuelans tasted it as 
the news spread like wildfire that Nicolás Maduro, who has ruled 
Venezuela through repression and ruin, had been removed in a 
dramatic American military operation. The shock was not just political 
but emotional. In Caracas and Maracaibo, in Miami and Madrid, 
Venezuelans allowed themselves to imagine a future full of hope, 
dignity and a return to normal life. 
But then, concern: just hours after the raid President Donald Trump 
declared that he would now “run” Venezuela. He talked much about oil 
but not at all about democracy other than to dismiss María Corina 
Machado, Nobel peace laureate and leader of the democratic 
opposition. (Ms Machado, he said, does not command the “respect” to 
run the country—despite Venezuelans having voted overwhelmingly 
for her alliance in an election in 2024 that Mr Maduro stole.) Instead, 
Mr Trump made clear, America will work with the dictator’s own vice-
president. He spoke as if he owned the country and its assets. 
Venezuelans will be recipients of his benevolence, not agents of their 
destiny. 
Removing a dictator—especially if leaving his henchmen and -women 
in charge—is not the same as rebuilding a country. And there is much 
to rebuild. When Mr Maduro came to power in 2013, Venezuelans 
were four times richer than they are today. A disaster followed: the 
largest economic contraction ever recorded in peacetime, triggering 
the departure of 8m Venezuelans. Brutality, repression and corruption 
accompanied the catastrophe. 
At its heart was a systematic dismantling of rights: property rights, 
independent courts and free elections. Speaking out became a crime. 
As rights vanished, so did security, investment, trust and the power to

imagine. People stopped planning for the future because the future no 
longer belonged to them. 
The lesson is simple: prosperity does not come from oil, decrees or 
even benevolent rulers, but from rights. Rights create private property 
and security. They allow people to invest, innovate and dream. Restore 
rights, and society can recover. 
Venezuelans now need neither revenge nor Trumpian improvisation, 
but a return to freedom and peace. The technology for that has already 
been invented: democracy, which is not just about voting but is a 
system for aggregating preferences while protecting liberties. 
Democracy aligns political authority with social consent and is the 
formula for sustained prosperity. Venezuela enjoyed it for much of the 
latter part of the 20th century. 
Gradually but relentlessly, the chavista project, which began in 1999, 
chipped away at checks and balances, individual freedoms and 
democracy itself. We must follow the process in reverse. There is no 
shortcut to restoring rights and the rule of law. 
Crucially, Venezuelans have already done the hardest bit, with courage 
and patience. In 2023 they rallied overwhelmingly behind Ms 
Machado, only to see her arbitrarily barred from running for president. 
In 2024 they delivered a landslide win for her colleague, Edmundo 
González Urrutia, voting against dictatorship in nearly every corner of 
the country. Venezuelans’ will could not have been clearer, though its 
translation into power was thwarted. It now needs to be honoured. 
Venezuela needs a civilian government constrained by law, respectful 
of individual freedoms, accountable to voters and capable of 
rebuilding institutions.

Mr. Trump does not understand this. He speaks as if Venezuela’s vast 
oil reserves make democracy unnecessary: foreign investment, above 
all from American oil companies, can substitute for political 
normalisation. It is a delusion, even on his terms. Oil is not wealth 
until output can be monetised, which requires long-term investment. 
For that, legal certainty—enforceable contracts, clear taxation and 
predictable rules governing concessions—is a must. Oil companies, 
which answer to shareholders, regulators and courts, won’t deploy 
capital into a legal vacuum. Without a legitimate legal system, the 
notion that oil reserves can rescue Venezuela—and earn America 
profits—collapses under scrutiny. 
A deeper risk is geopolitical. Venezuela must not become a colony, an 
afterthought or a transactional project driven by short-term American 
interests. America’s greatest successes after the second world war 
came not from extracting resources from Europe or Japan, but from 
providing public goods: security, institutional rebuilding and a rules-
based order allowing societies to prosper. The strategy created 
enormous benefits for the recipients—and for America itself. 
Venezuela needs the same liberal formula of peace, justice, democracy 
and rights. It needs citizens’ intense desire for democracy to be 
harnessed, not sidelined. Otherwise, the seeds of future conflict will 
grow, especially if national aspirations collide with American 
priorities. 
Sadness, as the song reminds us, has no end. Venezuela has endured 
more than its share. But those fleeting hours of happiness revealed 
something essential: Venezuelans have not given up on democracy, 
nor on each other. The task now is to create out of that a durable 
reality: not through force, nor through oil fantasies, but by restoring

the will of the people so that they can start the hard, patient work of 
restoring rights and rebuilding institutions. That is the only path by 
which happiness, fragile as it is, might finally find a way to endure. ■
