- 10) Authoritarian Political Economy (Acemoglu & Robinson): **1.9/10** *(uncertainty: high)*

### Theory-by-theory justification
- **1) Delegation / Principal-Agent (9.3/10):**
  - Why it fits: The notes repeatedly frame governance as delegation under information asymmetry: delegation is a "solution" but it creates "principal-agent" risk and "information asymmetry" (line 64). The Bellevue case explicitly documents agent drift, metric gaming, and weak monitoring (line 68).
  - Why above others: This logic travels across health, military adaptation, and implementation design cases in the notes (lines 64-68).
  - Hole: P-A explains control problems better than mass-politics framing battles.
- **2) Collective Action (9.0/10):**
  - Why it fits: Olson is explicit that shared interests do not automatically generate cooperation, and "selective incentives" are required (line 46). The notes apply this to global public goods and PEPFAR scale-up under concentrated leadership (line 48).
  - Why below #1: Collective action explains mobilization and contribution, but not implementer behavior after delegation.
  - Hole: Does not by itself specify which monitoring institutions work best.
- **3) Oversight (8.6/10):**
  - Why it fits: The file directly contrasts "fire-alarm" and "police patrol" oversight (line 124), then applies it to VW regulatory evasion and disaster response capacity failures (lines 125-126).
  - Why below #2: Oversight is mostly a mechanism for controlling delegated agents, not a full political-economy theory on its own.
  - Hole: Works best when alarm channels are legally protected and usable.
- **4) Strategic Action (8.2/10):**
  - Why it fits: The notes highlight "Look ahead and reason back" and bargaining structure/timing effects (line 39). This maps to coalition sequencing, reform windows, and negotiation under shrinking payoffs.
  - Why below #3: Strategy appears often, but many cases are more about structure/institutions than pure game play.
  - Hole: Strategic reasoning can describe behavior without identifying deeper institutional constraints.
- **5) Psychology (7.1/10):**
  - Why it fits: Kahneman’s System 1/System 2 and perception errors are applied to political misperception dynamics (lines 55, 58).
  - Why below #4: The notes use psychology mainly for voter perception/attention, less for institutional design.
  - Hole: Perception dynamics are hard to separate from deliberate elite messaging strategies.
- **6) Separation of Powers (6.4/10):**
  - Why it fits: Institutional conflict and veto structure appear in climate law durability debates and executive-legislative tensions (lines 26, 82).
  - Why below #5: It is often background structure rather than the immediate explanatory driver in Section 1 cases.
  - Hole: Less useful for implementation-heavy cases compared with P-A/oversight.
- **7) Voting Rules (5.7/10):**
  - Why it fits: The notes summarize disproportionality and single-winner incentives (line 92), which matter for communication and coalition incentives.
  - Why below #6: Section 1 policy implementation cases do not hinge directly on vote-seat conversion rules.
  - Hole: Rule effects are mostly indirect in these cases.
- **8) Electoral Systems / Cox (5.4/10):**
  - Why it fits: Agenda control and plenary-time scarcity provide a strong institutional lens (line 76).
  - Why below #7: These concepts are central for legislature organization but less directly tied to air pollution and delivery failures.
  - Hole: Requires richer legislative process evidence to move higher.
- **9) Selectorate (2.1/10, high uncertainty):**
  - Why it fits: Only weakly relevant in democratic governance cases.
  - Why low: Winning coalition logic is not the core mechanism in this section.
- **10) Authoritarian Political Economy (1.9/10, high uncertainty):**
  - Why it fits: Mostly out-of-domain for democratic implementation cases.
  - Why lowest: Mechanisms are tailored to elite survival under authoritarian threat.

### Theory interaction map
- **Reinforcing pairs/groups:**
  - Collective Action + Delegation: large-group coordination problems force institutional delegation (lines 46, 64).
  - Delegation + Oversight: agency loss motivates fire-alarm/patrol design (lines 64, 124-126).
  - Strategic Action + Oversight: actors adapt to monitoring structures, so oversight design must anticipate strategic evasion (lines 39, 125).
  - Psychology + Collective Action: perception errors shape whether broad publics recognize shared interests and mobilize (line 58).
- **Countering/conflicting pairs/groups:**
  - Rational strategy vs cognitive-bias interpretation: behavior may be tactical, not heuristic error.
  - Broad public-good logic (Olson) vs concentrated implementation control (P-A): agreement on goals does not prevent agent drift.

### Theoretical holes and balancing critiques
- The source is lecture-note synthesis, not uniform process-tracing evidence.
- Several entries are normatively framed, so mechanism confidence should be moderate.
- Some classes blend theory and interpretation, making causal attribution partly inferential.

### Balanced exam-ready claim (best argument + best counterargument)
- **Best argument:** Democratic policy outcomes in these notes are best explained by a sequence: collective-action constraints force delegation, and delegation quality is determined by oversight design under information asymmetry (lines 46, 64, 124-126).
- **Best counterargument:** Voter perception and narrative competition can dominate institutional design effects in electoral periods, meaning implementation fixes alone may underperform without political communication realignment (line 58).

## Section 2: Regime Power, Institutional Design, and Survival (Classes 6-10)

### Ranked theory list (congruence score)
- 1) Separation of Powers (Samuels): **9.2/10**
- 2) Selectorate Theory and Political Survival (Bueno de Mesquita et al.): **9.0/10**
- 3) Political Economy of Authoritarian Rule (Acemoglu & Robinson): **8.8/10**
- 4) Strategic Action and Coordination (Dixit & Nalebuff): **8.0/10**
- 5) Electoral Systems and Legislative Organization (Cox): **7.6/10**
- 6) Voting Rules and Political Incentives (Lijphart): **7.2/10**
- 7) Delegation and Principal-Agent (Kiewiet & McCubbins): **6.4/10**
- 8) Collective Action (Olson): **6.0/10**
- 9) Bureaucratic Oversight (McCubbins & Schwartz): **5.8/10**
- 10) Psychology of Decision-Making (Kahneman): **4.9/10**

### Theory-by-theory justification
- **1) Separation of Powers (9.2/10):**
  - Why it fits: The notes center decisiveness/resoluteness tradeoffs and institutional conflict; Mexico and Turkey are analyzed as deliberate reconfiguration of checks to centralize executive control (lines 75, 82, 85).
  - Why above others: It directly explains why institutional redesign, not just policy content, is the strategic objective.
  - Hole: Formal design alone cannot explain durability without party/elite alignment.
- **2) Selectorate Theory (9.0/10):**
  - Why it fits: The notes explicitly foreground winning coalition logic (line 101) and apply it to Xi’s personnel consolidation and loyalty screening (line 103).
  - Why below #1: Strongest in authoritarian cases, weaker in electoral-democratic redesign cases.
  - Hole: Coalition size/composition is inferred rather than quantified.
- **3) Acemoglu & Robinson (8.8/10):**
  - Why it fits: The notes emphasize political replacement risk and elite blocking, then apply it to Saudi and Indonesia trajectories (lines 113, 116, 118).
  - Why below #2: Explains long-run development politics well but is less granular on day-to-day institutional tactics.
  - Hole: Needs tighter counterfactuals to separate elite fear from state-capacity limits.
- **4) Strategic Action (8.0/10):**
  - Why it fits: Reform timing windows and institutional lock-in moves (Mexico/Turkey/Xi) are strategic sequencing problems (lines 39, 75, 85, 103).
  - Why below #3: Strategy describes moves but not deeper incentive origins.
- **5) Electoral Systems / Cox (7.6/10):**
  - Why it fits: Agenda control, party gatekeeping, and plenary-time scarcity explain how dominant parties convert temporary leverage into institutional redesign power (lines 75, 76).
  - Why below #4: In non-democracies, coercive and elite-survival logics often dominate legislative organization effects.
- **6) Voting Rules / Lijphart (7.2/10):**
  - Why it fits: Rule-induced disproportionality and single-winner incentives help explain how narrow victories can yield outsized governing control (lines 85, 92).
  - Why below #5: Voting-rule mechanics are important but secondary to survival incentives and constitutional restructuring.
- **7) Delegation / P-A (6.4/10):**
  - Why it fits: COVID mortality undercount analysis highlights reporting-chain distortion and center-periphery information filtering (line 106).
  - Why below #5: More diagnostic than primary in regime design disputes.
- **8) Collective Action (6.0/10):**
  - Why it fits: Opposition coordination and mass preference signaling matter in referendum and backsliding contexts (lines 85, 95-96).
  - Why below #6: Elite institutional engineering often constrains conversion of mass preferences into power.
- **9) Oversight (5.8/10):**
  - Why it fits: Oversight erosion appears as part of democratic backsliding packages.
  - Why below #7: In the cases, oversight is outcome more than driver.
- **10) Psychology (4.9/10):**
  - Why it fits: Fear, framing, and spiral-of-silence dynamics can condition voter/elite behavior (lines 85, 96).
  - Why below #8: Evidence is suggestive; institutional incentives dominate.

### Theory interaction map
- **Reinforcing pairs/groups:**
  - Separation of Powers + Selectorate: constitutional redesign and loyalty coalition management jointly entrench executive authority (lines 75, 82, 101, 103).
  - Acemoglu + Selectorate: elite survival incentives and coalition maintenance align under threat (lines 101, 113, 118).
  - Strategic Action + Electoral Rules: timing reform windows and rule redesign converts temporary majorities into durable power (lines 75, 85, 92).
  - P-A + Information control: center receives filtered signals under authoritarian incentives, weakening corrective feedback (line 106).
- **Countering/conflicting pairs/groups:**
  - Formal democratic legitimacy vs substantive accountability: majoritarian mandates can coexist with check erosion.
  - Electoral-rule explanations vs coercive-capacity explanations: in some settings, coercion matters more than vote conversion.

### Theoretical holes and balancing critiques
- Some case notes summarize secondary commentary; primary empirical foundations vary.
- Causal pathways in authoritarian settings are partly inferred from observed outcomes.
- COVID mortality estimates are probabilistic and explicitly uncertain in-source (line 106).

### Balanced exam-ready claim (best argument + best counterargument)
- **Best argument:** Across Mexico, Turkey, China, Saudi, and Indonesia cases, institutional redesign and elite-coalition management are best explained by separation-of-powers tradeoffs plus selectorate/elite-survival logic (lines 75, 82, 85, 101, 103, 113, 118).
- **Best counterargument:** Overemphasis on elite strategy can understate the role of public legitimacy shocks, economic performance failures, and information-quality collapse in destabilizing otherwise durable arrangements (line 106).

## Section 3: Cross-section synthesis

### Which theories are consistently strongest across Jason Fry notes
- Delegation/P-A and Collective Action dominate policy implementation and public-goods delivery cases (lines 46, 64, 124-126).
- Separation of Powers and Selectorate logic dominate institutional-power and regime-survival cases (lines 75, 82, 101, 103).
- Strategic Action is consistently cross-cutting because timing and sequencing recur in both democratic and authoritarian settings (line 39).

### Where rankings change and why
- Collective Action drops when moving from delivery problems to regime entrenchment: mass preferences matter less when elite gatekeeping tightens.
- Selectorate and Acemoglu rise sharply in non-democracy/elite-survival sections (lines 101, 113, 118).
- Oversight rises in implementation failures but is more downstream in constitutional redesign cases (lines 124-126 vs 75-85).

### Major complementarities and contradictions
- Complementarity: Collective Action -> Delegation -> Oversight forms a coherent democratic governance chain.
- Complementarity: Separation of Powers + Electoral Rules + Strategic timing explains how legal reform can entrench power.
- Contradiction: Electoral legitimacy narratives can coexist with substantive accountability erosion.
- Contradiction: Information-control regimes can preserve short-run stability while increasing long-run decision brittleness (line 106).

### Concise exam claim vs counterclaim pairs
- **Claim:** Broad policy consensus should produce policy action.  
  **Counterclaim:** Without selective incentives and enforceable institutional design, consensus underproduces action (line 46).
- **Claim:** Delegation improves state capacity.  
  **Counterclaim:** Delegation without aligned incentives and independent monitoring can produce agent drift and harm (lines 64, 68, 124-126).
- **Claim:** Strong executive centralization improves decisiveness.  
  **Counterclaim:** It can also weaken accountability channels and raise medium-term regime fragility (lines 82, 85, 103, 106).
- **Claim:** Formal electoral victories settle legitimacy questions.  
  **Counterclaim:** Rule changes, information asymmetry, and uneven campaign conditions can distort mandate interpretation (lines 85, 106).
- **Claim:** State-led modernization reliably produces durable development.  
  **Counterclaim:** If elites fear replacement or preserve rent extraction, modernization can become unstable or partial (lines 113, 116, 118).
