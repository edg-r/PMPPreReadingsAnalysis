### Theory-by-theory justification
- **1) Collective Action (9.4/10):**
  - Why it fits: A broad NGO-industry coalition coordinates around a shared policy package despite heterogeneous preferences, which is textbook mobilization under partial common interest (Review Slides, lines 100-107, 112-118; Reading A, lines 23-37).
  - Why above others: The central political act in the text is coalition formation and joint signaling before a hearing, which is more directly Olson-type than institutional-design-first explanation (Review Slides, lines 102-105; Reading A, lines 24-27, 49-51).
  - Holes: Signature breadth does not prove resolved free-riding or durable contribution mechanisms.
- **2) Strategic Action + Commitment (8.6/10):**
  - Why it fits: The letter is timed immediately before a Senate hearing and pushes codification to reduce policy uncertainty, consistent with sequential strategy and commitment logic (Review Slides, lines 89-97; Reading A, lines 24-25, 27-29, 41).
  - Why below #1: The text provides little direct payoff/equilibrium detail; strategic interpretation is strong but partly inferred.
  - Holes: Could be symbolic pressure rather than equilibrium-calculated bargaining.
- **3) Delegation / Principal-Agent (7.8/10):**
  - Why it fits: Calls for limiting political interference and improving judicial review imply concerns about agency loss, information asymmetry, and institutional controls (Review Slides, lines 160-168; Reading A, lines 39-41).
  - Why below #2: P-A chain is implied rather than explicitly traced actor-by-actor.
  - Holes: Delays might stem from principal-imposed legal safeguards, not agent drift.
- **4) Oversight (7.1/10):**
  - Why it fits: The Senate hearing context maps to centralized oversight; judicial/public channels in permitting can function as decentralized alert mechanisms (Review Slides, lines 314-324; Reading A, lines 24-26, 39).
  - Why below #3: Oversight appears as an instrument within broader delegation conflict rather than the main causal frame.
  - Holes: No clear sanction or monitoring design is specified.
- **5) Separation of Powers (5.9/10):**
  - Why it fits: The letter targets bicameral legislative coordination and seeks stable codified rules to reduce policy volatility across political cycles (Review Slides, lines 216-223; Reading A, lines 49-50, 41).
  - Why below #4: Branch-level conflict is background, not the core argument of the reading.
  - Holes: Limited evidence on executive-legislative or judicial veto conflict.
- **6) Psychology (5.2/10):**
  - Why it fits: Framing combines affordability, security, and environment to increase salience and reduce resistance, consistent with availability/loss framing tactics (Review Slides, lines 139-141, 149; Reading A, lines 45-48).
  - Why below #5: Evidence is rhetorical output, not direct cognitive-process evidence.
  - Holes: Strategic messaging can be fully rational without heuristics.
- **7) Voting Rules (3.9/10, uncertainty medium-high):**
  - Why it fits: Bipartisan positioning may target pivotal legislators under majoritarian incentive structures.
  - Why below #6: No explicit electoral-rule mechanisms appear in the text (Review Slides, lines 238-249; Reading A, lines 23-24).
  - Holes: Inference-heavy; weak direct support.
- **8) Electoral Systems (3.5/10, uncertainty high):**
  - Why it fits: US institutional context is present, but party-system mechanics are not developed.
  - Why below #7: Duverger-style party-structure predictions are not testable from this document (Review Slides, lines 191-203; Reading A, lines 24-26).
  - Holes: Theory-data mismatch.
- **9) Authoritarian Political Economy (1.6/10, uncertainty very high):**
  - Why it fits: Only via strained analogy about elites shaping rules for power.
  - Why below #8: Core authoritarian assumptions do not match this democratic congressional lobbying case (Review Slides, lines 303-307; Reading A, lines 22-51).
  - Holes: Overreach risk is high.
- **10) Selectorate Theory (1.3/10, uncertainty very high):**
  - Why it fits: Coalition language exists, but not selectorate mechanics.
  - Why lowest: No nominal/real/winning coalition evidence in the selectorate sense (Review Slides, lines 261-268; Reading A, lines 23-51).
  - Holes: Minimal explanatory leverage.

### Theory interaction map
- **Reinforcing pairs/groups:**
  - Collective Action + Strategic Coordination: coalition solves mobilization and times intervention to a key institutional moment (Review Slides, lines 89-97, 100-118; Reading A, lines 24-27).
  - Principal-Agent + Oversight: oversight mechanisms are concrete tools to manage agency loss (Review Slides, lines 160-168, 314-324; Reading A, lines 39-41).
  - Commitment logic + Separation-of-Powers: codification is a strategy to reduce instability across actors and time (Review Slides, lines 95-97, 216-223; Reading A, line 41).
- **Countering/conflicting pairs/groups:**
  - Rational strategic models vs psychology framing: policy choice can be read as equilibrium play or as salience management.
  - Collective-action optimism vs P-A skepticism: coalition agreement does not ensure implementation fidelity.
  - Democratic institutional lenses vs selectorate/authoritarian lenses: assumption mismatch weakens cross-application.

### Theoretical holes and balancing critiques
- One advocacy letter cannot establish causal mechanism with high confidence (Reading A, lines 22-51).
- Uncertainty and delay could reflect precautionary legal design, not pure bureaucratic failure (Reading A, lines 27-29, 43-44).
- Broad coalition can signal either genuine convergence or lowest-common-denominator bargaining (Reading A, lines 36-40).
- Low-ranked theories are included for completeness but should be flagged as overreach if presented as primary.

### Balanced exam-ready claim (best argument + best counterargument)
- **Best argument:** Reading A is primarily an Olson + strategic-commitment case: heterogeneous actors overcome coordination barriers, package selective priorities, and push codified certainty at a pivotal hearing node (Review Slides, lines 89-97, 102-107; Reading A, lines 24-41).
- **Best counterargument:** Coalition breadth may be cheap talk; without explicit delegation and oversight architecture, certainty reforms may lock in organized-interest advantages rather than improve accountable implementation (Review Slides, lines 160-168, 314-324; Reading A, lines 39-41).

## Section 2: Reading B

### Ranked theory list (congruence score)
- 1) Political Economy of Authoritarian Rule (Acemoglu-Robinson): **9.6/10**
- 2) Selectorate Theory and Political Survival: **9.2/10**
- 3) Separation of Powers: **8.6/10**
- 4) Strategic Action and Coordination (commitment problems): **7.7/10**
- 5) Collective Action / Olson: **6.9/10**
- 6) Delegation and Principal-Agent: **6.6/10**
- 7) Voting Rules and Political Incentives: **6.2/10** *(uncertainty: medium)*
- 8) Bureaucratic Oversight: **5.1/10**
- 9) Psychology of Decision-Making: **4.8/10**
- 10) Electoral Systems and Legislative Behavior: **3.4/10** *(uncertainty: high)*

### Theory-by-theory justification
- **1) Authoritarian Political Economy (9.6/10):**
  - Why it fits: The reading directly links rights erosion, repression, blocked competition, and economic collapse, matching elite power-preservation over growth (Review Slides, lines 303-307; Reading B, lines 44-51, 67-70).
  - Why above others: The text explicitly makes the political-institutions-to-prosperity causal claim.
  - Holes: Mechanisms are plausible but not empirically decomposed (intentional blocking vs state incapacity).
- **2) Selectorate Theory (9.2/10):**
  - Why it fits: Stolen elections and continued reliance on regime insiders map to survival through narrow essential support rather than broad consent (Review Slides, lines 261-268, 275-279; Reading B, lines 37-39, 74-77).
  - Why below #1: W/S ratio and private-goods allocation are inferred, not measured in-text.
  - Holes: Coalition size/composition evidence is indirect.
- **3) Separation of Powers (8.6/10):**
  - Why it fits: The reading explicitly diagnoses collapse of checks and balances and calls for civilian government constrained by law and accountable institutions (Review Slides, lines 216-223; Reading B, lines 68-70, 78-80).
  - Why below #2: It explains institutional remedy more than incumbent survival logic.
  - Holes: Transition sequencing and enforcement capacity remain underspecified.
- **4) Strategic Action + Commitment (7.7/10):**
  - Why it fits: The legal-certainty argument for investment is a commitment-credibility claim; criticism of improvised external control points to time-consistency risk (Review Slides, lines 95-97; Reading B, lines 83-93).
  - Why below #3: Political survival and institutional collapse are more central than strategic timing details.
  - Holes: Restoring credibility in weak-rule contexts is difficult and slower than asserted.
- **5) Collective Action (6.9/10):**
  - Why it fits: Opposition coordination and mass voting reveal successful anti-dictatorship mobilization (Review Slides, lines 103-107, 115-117; Reading B, lines 71-77).
  - Why below #4: Mobilization success did not translate into power due institutional blockage.
  - Holes: Free-rider mitigation/enforcement mechanisms are not detailed.
- **6) Principal-Agent (6.6/10):**
  - Why it fits: Citizens as principals faced severe agency loss where rulers acted against public preferences, and monitoring/sanction pathways were weakened (Review Slides, lines 162-168; Reading B, lines 49-51, 76-80).
  - Why below #5: Under authoritarian control, standard P-A accountability assumptions are structurally weakened.
  - Holes: Theory may underplay coercion compared with survival logic.
- **7) Voting Rules (6.2/10, uncertainty medium):**
  - Why it fits: The reading centers on preference aggregation and blocked vote translation into authority, directly invoking democratic aggregation logic (Review Slides, lines 238-240; Reading B, lines 62-65, 76-77).
  - Why below #6: It lacks concrete electoral-rule design details (FPTP/PR thresholds).
  - Holes: Fraud/coercion may dominate formal rule effects.
- **8) Oversight (5.1/10):**
  - Why it fits: Rebuilding accountable institutions implies need for monitoring architecture.
  - Why below #7: No explicit police-patrol/fire-alarm mechanism is specified (Review Slides, lines 316-324; Reading B, lines 78-80).
  - Holes: Oversight is downstream of legitimacy restoration.
- **9) Psychology (4.8/10):**
  - Why it fits: Oil-first framing may involve anchoring/attribute substitution in public argumentation (Review Slides, lines 141, 149; Reading B, lines 83-87).
  - Why below #8: Cognitive bias evidence is interpretive, not directly observed.
  - Holes: Could be deliberate strategic messaging, not heuristic error.
- **10) Electoral Systems (3.4/10, uncertainty high):**
  - Why it fits: Elections are discussed, but system-structure mechanics are not.
  - Why lowest: Duverger and threshold claims cannot be evaluated from this text (Review Slides, lines 191-203; Reading B, lines 72-77).
  - Holes: Theory-data mismatch.

### Theory interaction map
- **Reinforcing pairs/groups:**
  - Authoritarian Political Economy + Selectorate: power-preservation incentives explain both repression and economic distortion (Review Slides, lines 275-279, 303-307; Reading B, lines 49-51, 67-70).
  - Separation-of-Powers + Principal-Agent + Oversight: institutional checks are required to convert popular will into accountable governance (Review Slides, lines 216-223, 314-324; Reading B, lines 76-80).
  - Strategic commitment + institutional-rights logic: legal predictability is needed for investment and rebuilding (Review Slides, lines 95-97; Reading B, lines 88-93).
- **Countering/conflicting pairs/groups:**
  - Collective action optimism (clear voter will) vs selectorate realism (incumbent survival despite mass opposition).
  - External-control strategy vs legitimacy-through-consent argument.
  - Formal voting rules vs coercive capacity explanations for outcomes.

### Theoretical holes and balancing critiques
- The source is an op-ed, so causal claims are strong-form normative arguments, not full process-tracing (Reading B, lines 56-65).
- Intentional elite blocking and generalized state weakness are not fully disentangled.
- Electoral-rule inferences should be labeled medium/high uncertainty due missing rule detail.
- Transition strategy is normatively clear but operationally thin on enforcement sequencing.

### Balanced exam-ready claim (best argument + best counterargument)
- **Best argument:** Reading B is best explained by the combined logic of Authoritarian Political Economy + Selectorate + Separation of Powers: narrow survival incentives drove rights/institution erosion and economic collapse; recovery requires enforceable rule-bound, accountable governance (Review Slides, lines 261-279, 303-307, 216-223; Reading B, lines 49-51, 67-70, 78-80).
- **Best counterargument:** Rights-restoration is necessary but not sufficient; without a credible transition coalition and enforcement architecture, formal democratic commitments can remain nominal and reversible (Review Slides, lines 95-97, 292-296; Reading B, lines 76-77, 113-115).

## Section 3: Cross-reading synthesis

### Which theories are consistently strongest across both readings
- Strategic action/commitment is consistently high because both cases center on credibility, sequencing, and institutional durability (Review Slides, lines 89-97).
- Delegation/oversight remains relevant in both, though central in Reading A and supporting in Reading B (Review Slides, lines 160-168, 314-324).
- Collective action is strong across both, but in Reading B it is constrained by blocked translation from preferences to power (Review Slides, lines 103-107; Reading B, lines 76-77).

### Where rankings change between readings and why
- Collective Action: #1 in Reading A, mid-tier in Reading B because B demonstrates institutional veto/coercion after mobilization (Reading A, lines 23-37; Reading B, lines 76-77).
- Selectorate + Authoritarian Political Economy: near-bottom in A, top in B due direct regime-type fit in B (Review Slides, lines 261-279, 303-307; Reading B, lines 49-51, 67-70).
- Separation of Powers: rises in B because checks-and-balances breakdown is explicit and causal (Reading B, lines 68-70, 78-80).

### Major theory-to-theory complementarities and contradictions across cases
- Complementarity: Collective Action + Strategic Coordination in both cases, but with different constraints (institutional access in A vs institutional blockage in B).
- Complementarity: P-A + Oversight tools matter in both, but feasibility differs by regime context.
- Contradiction: Democratic coalition/public-goods logic (A) conflicts with narrow-coalition survival logic (B).
- Contradiction: Preference aggregation can succeed procedurally in democratic settings but fail when enforcement institutions are captured.

### 3-5 concise exam claim vs counterclaim pairs
- **Claim:** Broad coalition letters indicate solved collective action.  
  **Counterclaim:** They indicate alignment signaling, not necessarily solved enforcement/contribution problems.
- **Claim:** Codifying rules solves uncertainty.  
  **Counterclaim:** Codification can also entrench rigid or captured rules without accountability upgrades.
- **Claim:** Mass anti-dictatorship voting proves transition readiness.  
  **Counterclaim:** Mobilization without enforceable institutions does not guarantee power transfer.
- **Claim:** Post-dictator oil strategy can drive fast recovery.  
  **Counterclaim:** Without credible legal commitments, investment remains unlikely despite reserves.
- **Claim:** Elections are the core fix.  
  **Counterclaim:** Elections plus checks, oversight, and real accountability expansion are required for durable recovery.
