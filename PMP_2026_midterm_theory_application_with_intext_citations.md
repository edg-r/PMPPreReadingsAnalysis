### Theory-by-theory justification
- **1) Collective Action (9.4/10):**
  - Why it fits: `"Collective action problems arise when individuals fail to contribute to public goods due to free-riding incentives"` plus `"a broad, bipartisan group of NGO and industry representatives"` and `"stakeholders may not agree on individual elements"` (Review Slides, lines 103-104; Reading A, lines 23-24, 36).
  - Why above others: The dominant move is coalition aggregation around one legislative ask: `"encourage the advancement of comprehensive permitting reform legislation"` (Reading A, lines 26-27).
  - Holes: Signature breadth is observable, but contribution enforcement is not directly shown.
- **2) Strategic Action + Commitment (8.6/10):**
  - Why it fits: `"Decision-makers must anticipate the endgame"` and `"Time inconsistency: Future leaders may renege"` map to a pre-hearing intervention plus codification: `"January 28 Hearing"` and `"codifying permitting certainty measures"` (Review Slides, lines 89, 97; Reading A, lines 24-25, 41).
  - Why below #1: Strategic intent is plausible, but explicit payoff matrix/equilibrium behavior is not present.
  - Holes: Could be symbolic agenda signaling rather than fully strategic equilibrium behavior.
- **3) Delegation / Principal-Agent (7.8/10):**
  - Why it fits: `"Agency Loss"` and `"Information asymmetry"` align with concern over `"political interference"` and demand for `"improved judicial review"` (Review Slides, lines 162, 165; Reading A, lines 39-41).
  - Why below #2: Principal-agent chains are implied, not spelled out actor-by-actor.
  - Holes: Delay may come from principal-imposed legal constraints, not agent drift.
- **4) Oversight (7.1/10):**
  - Why it fits: `"Congress actively and regularly inspects"` (police patrol) and institutional complaint channels (fire alarm) fit the hearing context and review process concerns (Review Slides, lines 316-323; Reading A, lines 24-26, 39).
  - Why below #3: Oversight is a mechanism layer within a broader coalition/delegation conflict.
  - Holes: No explicit monitoring trigger/sanction design is specified in the letter.
- **5) Separation of Powers (5.9/10):**
  - Why it fits: `"division of government responsibilities into distinct branches"` and US congressional bargaining context are relevant to `"continued partnership with your colleagues in both chambers"` (Review Slides, lines 216-217; Reading A, lines 49-50).
  - Why below #4: Branch conflict is background, not the text’s main explanatory engine.
  - Holes: Evidence of direct inter-branch deadlock is thin.
- **6) Psychology (5.2/10):**
  - Why it fits: `"Availability heuristic"` and `"Loss Aversion"` can interpret the letter’s bundled salience framing: `"energy affordability, national security, and environmental benefits"` (Review Slides, lines 139, 149; Reading A, lines 45-46).
  - Why below #5: The text shows messaging output, not direct cognitive-process evidence.
  - Holes: Framing may be purely strategic rather than heuristic/bias-driven.
- **7) Voting Rules (3.9/10, uncertainty medium-high):**
  - Why it fits: `"Voting rules → incentives"` could weakly explain bipartisan coalition positioning toward pivotal legislators (Review Slides, line 238; Reading A, lines 23-24).
  - Why below #6: No concrete rule mechanism (district incentives, threshold effects) is in the reading.
  - Holes: Inference-heavy; low direct observability.
- **8) Electoral Systems (3.5/10, uncertainty high):**
  - Why it fits: Only weakly through general US legislative context.
  - Why below #7: `"majoritarian"` / `"proportional representation"` party-system dynamics are not evidenced in this document (Review Slides, lines 192-203).
  - Holes: Theory-data mismatch.
- **9) Authoritarian Political Economy (1.6/10, uncertainty very high):**
  - Why it fits: Only by strained analogy to `"Elites block economic progress when it threatens their political power"` (Review Slides, line 303).
  - Why below #8: Regime assumptions do not match this democratic congressional case.
  - Holes: Overreach risk is high.
- **10) Selectorate Theory (1.3/10, uncertainty very high):**
  - Why it fits: Superficial coalition language only.
  - Why lowest: No evidence of `"Nominal Selectorate"`, `"Real Selectorate"`, or `"Winning Coalition"` mechanics in Reading A (Review Slides, lines 262-267; Reading A, lines 23-51).
  - Holes: Minimal explanatory leverage.

### Theory interaction map
- **Reinforcing pairs/groups:**
  - Collective Action + Strategic Coordination: `"groups will emerge"` + `"anticipate the endgame"` + timed hearing intervention (Review Slides, lines 112-113, 89; Reading A, lines 24-27).
  - Principal-Agent + Oversight: `"Agency Loss"` is managed via `"Reporting and Monitoring"` and oversight tools (Review Slides, lines 162, 168, 316-323).
  - Commitment + Separation of Powers: `"Time inconsistency"` pressure supports codification in a multi-veto setting (Review Slides, line 97; Reading A, line 41).
- **Countering/conflicting pairs/groups:**
  - Rational strategic account vs bias account: `"Game theory provides a structured approach"` vs `"cognitive psychology helps explain ... deviate from rational decision-making"` (Review Slides, lines 85-86, 129-130).
  - Coalition agreement vs implementation control: collective alignment does not automatically remove agency loss.
  - Democratic institutional lenses vs autocratic survival lenses: assumption mismatch.

### Theoretical holes and balancing critiques
- Evidence base is one advocacy letter: `"We submit this letter"` (Reading A, line 23), so mechanism confidence should remain moderate.
- Delay causality is contested: could be overregulation or safety/legal checks, not just bureaucracy: `"safe deployment"` and `"uphold our strong environmental standards"` (Reading A, lines 29, 43).
- Coalition breadth can mean either true convergence or low-common-denominator language: `"stakeholders may not agree on individual elements"` (Reading A, line 36).

### Balanced exam-ready claim (best argument + best counterargument)
- **Best argument:** Reading A is primarily Olson + commitment strategy: `"free-riding incentives"` and coalition mobilization are handled through a coordinated, timed push for rule certainty (Review Slides, lines 103-104, 95-97; Reading A, lines 24-41).
- **Best counterargument:** Without explicit monitoring/enforcement architecture, codification can harden organized-interest influence rather than improve accountable implementation (`"Reporting and Monitoring"` / oversight logic) (Review Slides, lines 168, 316-324; Reading A, lines 39-41).

## Section 2: Reading B

### Ranked theory list (congruence score)
- 1) Political Economy of Authoritarian Rule (Acemoglu-Robinson): **9.6/10**
- 2) Selectorate Theory and Political Survival: **9.2/10**
- 3) Separation of Powers: **8.6/10**
- 4) Strategic Action and Coordination (commitment problems): **7.7/10**
- 5) Collective Action / Olson: **6.9/10**
- 6) Delegation and Principal-Agent: **6.6/10**
- 7) Voting Rules and Political Incentives: **6.2/10** *(uncertainty: medium)*
- 8) Bureaucratic Oversight: **5.1/10**
- 9) Psychology of Decision-Making: **4.8/10**
- 10) Electoral Systems and Legislative Behavior: **3.4/10** *(uncertainty: high)*

### Theory-by-theory justification
- **1) Authoritarian Political Economy (9.6/10):**
  - Why it fits: The reading directly tracks `"Elites block economic progress when it threatens their political power"` with evidence of `"systematic dismantling of rights"` and catastrophic contraction (Review Slides, line 303; Reading B, lines 49-50, 45-47).
  - Why above others: The core causal chain in the text is institutional rights collapse -> long-run economic ruin.
  - Holes: Intentional elite strategy and generalized governance incapacity are not fully separated.
- **2) Selectorate Theory (9.2/10):**
  - Why it fits: `"small group whose support is essential"` and `"Leaders maximize loyalty"` match stolen-election persistence and insider continuity (Review Slides, lines 266-267, 278; Reading B, lines 37, 38-39, 76-77).
  - Why below #1: W/S ratio and private/public goods allocation are inferred rather than measured.
  - Holes: Coalition structure is plausible but indirect in this text.
- **3) Separation of Powers (8.6/10):**
  - Why it fits: `"checks and balances"` erosion is explicitly diagnosed and paired with a call for law-bound civilian rule: `"constrained by law ... accountable to voters"` (Reading B, lines 68, 78-79).
  - Why below #2: It explains institutional remedy more than immediate survival mechanics.
  - Holes: Transition enforcement sequencing is underdeveloped.
- **4) Strategic Action + Commitment (7.7/10):**
  - Why it fits: `"Policymakers may struggle to make credible commitments"` maps to `"legal certainty—enforceable contracts, clear taxation and predictable rules"` for investment (Review Slides, lines 95-96; Reading B, lines 88-89).
  - Why below #3: Strategic commitment is important but subordinate to regime-survival and institutional breakdown narratives.
  - Holes: Rebuilding credibility under weak institutions is harder than stated.
- **5) Collective Action (6.9/10):**
  - Why it fits: `"Collective action in the real world: Voting"` aligns with mass anti-regime coordination: `"voted overwhelmingly"` and `"landslide win"` (Review Slides, lines 115-116; Reading B, lines 36, 74).
  - Why below #4: Mobilization did not convert into authority: `"translation into power was thwarted"` (Reading B, line 77).
  - Holes: Free-rider mitigation mechanisms are not specified.
- **6) Principal-Agent (6.6/10):**
  - Why it fits: `"Agency Loss"` and weak monitoring logic match citizen-principal inability to discipline rulers despite preferences (Review Slides, lines 162, 168; Reading B, lines 76-80).
  - Why below #5: Authoritarian coercion breaks standard democratic sanction assumptions.
  - Holes: P-A can understate coercion and survival incentives.
- **7) Voting Rules (6.2/10, uncertainty medium):**
  - Why it fits: Democracy is defined as `"aggregating preferences while protecting liberties"` and the failure is vote-to-power translation (Reading B, lines 62-63, 76-77).
  - Why below #6: No explicit FPTP/PR institutional architecture is given.
  - Holes: Fraud/coercion may dominate formal rule effects.
- **8) Oversight (5.1/10):**
  - Why it fits: Institutional rebuilding implies eventual need for `"hearings, audits, and investigations"` and reporting channels (Review Slides, lines 317-323; Reading B, lines 78-80).
  - Why below #7: Oversight design is not specified in operational detail.
  - Holes: Downstream reform, not immediate explanatory core.
- **9) Psychology (4.8/10):**
  - Why it fits: Oil-first framing may be anchoring: `"He talked much about oil but not at all about democracy"` (Reading B, lines 32-33).
  - Why below #8: Cognitive evidence is inferential, not directly observed.
  - Holes: Could be strategic rhetoric rather than heuristic error.
- **10) Electoral Systems (3.4/10, uncertainty high):**
  - Why it fits: Elections are discussed.
  - Why lowest: No evidence for `"Duverger’s Law"` or threshold-based party-structure mechanisms in this text (Review Slides, lines 243-245; Reading B, lines 72-77).
  - Holes: Theory-data mismatch.

### Theory interaction map
- **Reinforcing pairs/groups:**
  - Authoritarian Political Economy + Selectorate: `"threatening the ruling elite"` plus `"maximize loyalty"` jointly explain repression and distortion (Review Slides, lines 305, 278; Reading B, lines 49-50, 67-70).
  - Separation of Powers + Principal-Agent + Oversight: `"constrained by law"` governance is the institutional condition for reducing agency abuse (Reading B, line 78; Review Slides, lines 162-168, 316-323).
  - Commitment + rights restoration: `"legal certainty"` is required for durable investment and recovery (Reading B, lines 88-91).
- **Countering/conflicting pairs/groups:**
  - Collective-action optimism (`"landslide win"`) vs selectorate realism (`"translation into power was thwarted"`) (Reading B, lines 74, 77).
  - External-control narrative vs legitimacy-through-consent narrative: `"run Venezuela"` conflicts with `"social consent"` model (Reading B, lines 32, 64).
  - Formal rules account vs coercive-capacity account.

### Theoretical holes and balancing critiques
- Genre caveat: this is a normative argument with policy advocacy tone, not full causal process-tracing.
- Causal ambiguity remains between elite-intentional blocking and broad state fragility.
- Electoral-rule claims should stay explicitly uncertain unless rule design data is added.

### Balanced exam-ready claim (best argument + best counterargument)
- **Best argument:** Reading B is best captured by authoritarian political economy + selectorate + institutional constraints: rights destruction and narrow-coalition survival produced collapse; recovery needs enforceable law-bound accountability (`"constrained by law ... accountable to voters"`) (Reading B, lines 78-79; Review Slides, lines 303-307, 266-279).
- **Best counterargument:** `"restoring rights and rebuilding institutions"` is necessary but may be insufficient without credible transition enforcement and coalition restructuring (Reading B, lines 114-115; Review Slides, lines 292-296, 95-97).

## Section 3: Cross-reading synthesis

### Which theories are consistently strongest across both readings
- Strategic commitment logic is consistently relevant: `"credible commitments"` and `"time inconsistency"` matter in both policy reform and regime recovery contexts (Review Slides, lines 95-97).
- Delegation/oversight remains cross-cutting: `"Agency Loss"` and `"Reporting and Monitoring"` are useful in both settings, though with different feasibility (Review Slides, lines 162, 168).
- Collective action is strong in both, but binding constraints differ: coalition-building in A vs institutional blockage in B.

### Where rankings change between readings and why
- Collective Action drops from top in A to mid-tier in B because B explicitly states `"translation into power was thwarted"` (Reading B, line 77).
- Selectorate + authoritarian political economy rise sharply in B due direct regime fit: `"small group whose support is essential"` and `"Elites block economic progress"` (Review Slides, lines 266-267, 303).
- Separation of Powers rises in B because collapse/restoration of checks is explicit: `"checks and balances"` were chipped away (Reading B, line 68).

### Major theory-to-theory complementarities and contradictions across cases
- Complementarity: coalition mobilization + strategic sequencing in both cases.
- Complementarity: delegation + oversight in both, with stronger operational tractability in Reading A’s setting.
- Contradiction: democratic coalition/public-goods governance logic in A vs narrow-coalition survival logic in B.
- Contradiction: preference aggregation can be clear, but power transfer can still fail without institutional enforcement.

### 3-5 concise exam claim vs counterclaim pairs
- **Claim:** Broad coalition letters prove collective-action resolution.  
  **Counterclaim:** `"stakeholders may not agree on individual elements"` implies unresolved distributional conflict (Reading A, line 36).
- **Claim:** Codification resolves policy uncertainty.  
  **Counterclaim:** Without monitoring architecture, codification can still preserve agency loss (`"Reporting and Monitoring"`) (Review Slides, line 168).
- **Claim:** Mass voting proves democratic transition readiness.  
  **Counterclaim:** `"translation into power was thwarted"` shows institutional conversion failure (Reading B, line 77).
- **Claim:** Oil-led recovery can substitute for political reform.  
  **Counterclaim:** `"legal certainty ... is a must"` and capital `"won’t deploy ... into a legal vacuum"` (Reading B, lines 88-91).
- **Claim:** Elections alone are the fix.  
  **Counterclaim:** Recovery requires `"restoring rights and rebuilding institutions"` plus enforceable accountability (Reading B, lines 114-115, 78-80).
